<div class="content">
<div id="node-215" class="node  story">
<div class="content"><p><a href="http://blog.whurley.com/">Whurley</a>  just pointed to <a href="http://blogs.opennms.org/?p=75#more-75">Adventures in Open Source : Open Source is not a Marketing Term</a>  on the OMC  Mailing list.</p>
<p>This article has some really really good points that I have also been explaining to different folks before, and that I want to focus on again ..  they are mainly about what  open source is not .. and which kind of wanna be opensource companies or porjects  therefore you should better not  waste your time on .</p>
<p>Let's have a look :)</p>
<blockquote><p>Open source software development is not just about providing the source code for your application. It is much more about building a community around a shared project. That takes time. I think the biggest myth about open source software is that you say “hey, I’m open source now” and suddenly thousands of qualified people give up nights and weekends to work on your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or in other words,  Open Sourcing your end of life products helps noone.</p>
<p>He then compares Open Source to carpenting</p>
<blockquote><p>You can buy the same tools that a master craftsman uses, but it is doubtful that you can produce the same quality of work without investing a lot of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's  probably only a part of the comparison as carpenters  don't make their own tools or enhance the tools of their collegues.   But if they made their own tools,  which one would you choose,  the one that made , enhanced it  or wrote the book about his tools,  or the one that just started experimenting with a tool he never used  because you as a customer tought it might be interrested ?</p>
<blockquote><p>There is an independent community supporting the project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really crucial , every project starts with one or more people writing code,  but if that group doesn't grow and the project doesn't evolve  then what's the difference between binaries you get and a real open source project with onctributions,  indeed the lack of peer review.</p>
<pre></pre><blockquote>
<p>The company touting an open source application actually had a hand in writing it.<br />
Most of my loathing is reserved for those companies that claim to be open source, but in fact all they did is add a proprietary front end to an open source application. Ethan Galsteed’s Nagios has been a victim of this where his work and the work of his community has been co-opted by “parasites” who hope to cash in on the “open source” buzzword. They also tend to fail at the first two checks in the list as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh yes Nagios has been a victim of these a lot,  lots of companies out there that have written multiple plugins and are still selling those as proprietary software also ..luckily not all of them claim to be open source companies.<br />
Let's just hope they learn and  contribute back some day ..</p>
