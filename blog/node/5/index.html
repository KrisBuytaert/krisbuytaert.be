<div class="content"><p>I just got the strangest phonecall,  An older woman (I guess) looking for contact information , a phonenumber of one of my old bosses (Rudy Hageman).<br />
Apart from the fact that I used to be listed as dns contact for RealSoftware nothing could actually lead to my mobile phone number as the primary point of contact.</p>
<p>She first asked me if I knew him , off course , but I haven't seen the man since I left his company about 5 year ago. Then she asked if I had his phone number , but even if I had one it would have been an old one.   I suggested she called 1207 to get  his phonenumber telling her she should look around Edegem/Kontich since that where he lived.  I know his private address but I wasn't going to give that to anyone.  She then asked me If I could give her contact information for RealSoftware,  I replied that since he doesn't work there anymore , she should rather try to contact him at his new company.</p>
<p>She was surprised that I knew all those things,  to me they were general knowledge, everyone who follows our local IT economy even from a large distance knows these things.  Anyway I told her the name of the new company and  had a look at it's homepage while spelling it.   And guess what I found in the contact section .. exactly , a mobile phone number and an address.   I made a woman really really happy :)  Little does she know that I now have her name,  address , phonenumber</p>
<p>Wasted 2 minutes of my time, and had a good laugh afterwards Afterall, it probably was just a fscking DNS problem :)</p>
