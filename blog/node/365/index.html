<div class="content">
<div id="node-365" class="node  story">
<div class="content"><p>The <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampBrussels3">3rd Barcamp Brussels</a> is over,  I was a bit dissapointed over the target audience of the first Barcamp,  missed the second one, but the 3rd one was right where I expected it to be<br />
A healthy mix of technology,  startup projects and the social aspect of technology.</p>
<p>I took my <a href="http://www.tuxisalive.com/">Tuxdroid</a>  with me, planned on having him tell the audience what they were <a href="http://twitter.com/barcampbrussels">twittering</a> about, the idea was to take the logfile of my twitter jabber session and feed that to the text to speech deamon into Tux.  I failed due to the lack of network hence incoming twitter stream,  however the Tuxdroid proudly whacked its wings at the end of each talk :)</p>
<p>So about those talks :)</p>
<p>After <a href="http://blog.forret.com/">Peter</a> gave the startshot for the fight for a slot to talk I went to see the talk about <a href="http://www.gegis.org/">gegis</a> by  Dirk  Frigne.<br />
I totally didn't know there was an OpenSource project written for the Belgian governement which was into Gis .. cool stuff to see.</p>
<p><a href="http://frank.be/">Frank</a> then was next with his talk about <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>, I really should spend time with openid, hmm.. I kind of think I`m repeating myselve :)<br />
Then <a href="http://wonko.be/">Bernard</a> continued with his talk on Performance of webb applications which off course included a large part about Databases..<br />
I need to delete lots of stuff from my presentation :)</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.johnbaeyens.com/">John</a> introduced us to <a href="http://blog.notsoso.com/">NotSoso</a>,  now if only I could find some spare minutes to actually look into NotSoso,  I guess that that will be for later this week, or even after the weekend.</p>
<p>Then we had a 2 hour break for lunch and a groupfoto by <a href="http://blog.pictrix.be/">Steven</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.blogologie.be/">Maarten</a> did a talk about the <a href="http://www.blogoloog.be/">Blogoloog</a> and how he started out with an old Laptop with Fedora Core and now evolved into something more suitable , and <a href="http://www.vandenabeele.com/">Peter</a> explained us about <a href="http://www.taximize.be/">Belgian Tax Law</a> .</p>
<p>Then some people found me interresting enough to come and listen to <a href="http://www.x-tend.be/~kb/blog/index.php?2007/05/05/369-barcamp-brussels-mysql-presentation">my talk about MySQL Cluster</a>,  I actually had taken the talk I had been preparing for the MySQL Symposium that should have taken place in<br />
Amsterdam earlier this year and got cancelled.  That talk supposed to be over 2 hours.  So I kind of cut over 70% of the slides I had tried fitting them into a 20 minute talk.<br />
I kind of "managed" :)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ondernemeringent.be/">Bart</a> gave an interresting talk about your online reputation, how to screw it and how to protect it.  An interresting topic came up,  should you poison your blog to attract a different audience ?  Because according to him  your peers are probably not your customers and you should try to get new potential customers to know you .  So with that in mind.. what should I start blogging about ?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bnox.be/">Clo</a> and Bart Becks held a "Powerpoint Karaoke" on how to create a Sect, <a href="http://pietel.be/">Pietel</a> managed to take pictures that suggested that everybody actually joined the sect, that certainly wasn't true !<br />
After It's in the details by<a href="http://www.bornontheweb.be/"> Jesse</a> and an even more interresting talk about what we could do with <a href="http://hamstersoup.wordpress.com/2007/05/05/barcamp-brussels-my-freebase-talk/">Freebase  by Will</a>   I headed home exhausted, but satisfied.</p>
<p>I`m sure I missed some other interresting talks like the one from Toon Vanagt about <a href="http://www.transferitonline.com/">TransferItOnline</a> but other events will come where I can meet and talk to those people again !</p>
