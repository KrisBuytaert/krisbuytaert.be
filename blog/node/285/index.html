  <h2 id="title">How to manage parsable code in a large infrastructure.</h2>
<div class="content">
<div id="node-285" class="node  story">
<div class="content"><p>I already touched the topic  in the previous article,  but I've been wondering,  how do you ideally manage say Perl or PHP code in a Large Environment.<br />
As earlier noted     I want a system to be    reproducability under    version control and I want to be able to identify the source of every single file on my system either as belonging to a package or being transferred there from my version control platform.</p>
<p>For the ease of reading let's say we stick to mass deploying PHP Code.      Libraries most certainly belong to be in packages.  One can disuss where your own code belings.<br />
sTypically PHP code, html layout and Stylesheets are small files that are modified manually by a developer .  Often really small changes are being made to those files.<br />
These changes don't need to be recompiled in order to be used so shops that use this kind of code don't always have tradition of build and release management.</p>
<p>I`m thinking about abusing configuration management tools to manage code and just consider code as a configuration file.<br />
Amongst the disadvantages of using these file based management tools , puppet/cfengine/yourpoison but it should be a tool that makes it as easy for you to update 1 file on 1 machine as 1 file on 2000 machines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unclear file origin , you have no direct link anymore between the file and where it came from on the machine as it doesn't show up in a package list and rpm -qf doesn't  help you either</li>
<li>You need a  tool , most people these days know either rpm or dpkg , either  apt or yum, using  a tool such as CFengine or Puppet makes it  more complex for new people to step in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DisAdvantages of packaging code</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a less granular way of defining which files need to be modified,  it's an all or nothing approach , however you can define how small your packages  are</li>
<li>You need a build framework to build the packages, off course this can be automated.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use tagging wisely you're sure that either way you know which version is on the production platform.<br />
Most configuration management systems have features that allow you to verify if a file is changed or to to do a certain action after you update this so that's not an issue.<br />
Is using a  package per application really that much overhead ?   If you already have the infrastructure in place to build your packages then what's the extra effort ?</p>
<p>I've used both approaches so far,  a lot depends on the culture of the developers team and the already existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>So what's your opinion ?</p>
