  <h2 id="title">Fosdem 2007 , late toughts</h2>
<div class="content">
<div id="node-330" class="node  story">
<div class="content"><p>I know.. Fosdem is already over for almost 2 weeks.  But I was <a href="http://www.x-tend.be/~kb/blog/index.php?2007/03/05/332-to-write-or-not-to-write">busy writing other stuff</a>  , so I`m catching up now.</p>
<p>Sounds weird, but somehow eventhough fosdem is getting crowdier every year it also seems to be better organised.<br />
The focus is moving away from the main conference track and into the hallway and devroom tracks.  That's where the people meet.</p>
<p>Matt and I arrived rather early at Fosdem on saturday ,   for once that RMS wasn't giving a keynote I took the opportunity to actually go there and catch parts of both the OLPC and the Java talk.  Nothing new about the first one,  Sun marketing in the second one.  I`m not used to the kind of talks Simon Phipps gave,  this was more a commercial or a TV show trying to entertain the audience rather than actually teach them stuff. hmm.. probably that's why they call it a KeyNote.      The <a href="http://www.madstop.com/">Puppet community</a> kind of arranged to meet at 1400 at the entrance of the <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/devroom/centosfedora">Centos/Fedora room</a> , so I tried to catch a glimp of Luke there and succeeded.   <a href="http://www.karan.org/blog/">Karanbir</a> had kindly offered his timeslot for Puppet talk on sunday.<br />
After lots of other hallway encounters, pointing me to a really nice <a href="http://www.x-tend.be/~kb/blog/index.php?2007/03/04/330-nluug-najaarsconferentie-2007">NLUUG Virtualisation Conference Schedule</a> and the <a href="http://www.x-tend.be/~kb/blog/index.php?2007/03/04/331-t-dose-future">new dates for T-Dose</a>, I managed to see the LinuxBios talk,  I really should spend some time looking at this .. some day ..</p>
<p>After this talk I headed back to the CentOS room to see <a href="http://www.arrfab.net/">Fabian talk about eID</a>,  then Federic about OpenVZ  , realised that I really should spend time looking at <a href="http://directory.fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora Directory Server</a>,  it should be really familiar, as in august it will only be 7 years since I took the IPlanet Directory Service training in London :) , auch .. time flies when you're having fun at the open side ;) Things I wrote down from FedoraDS were the multimaster replication , the Virtual Views you can use when organisations realise they should have paid you for the formal LDAP analysis , Chaining of directories and much more.</p>
<p>After the last talk from Dab about RPMForge we had a photoop :)</p>
<p><img src="http://www.x-tend.be/~kb/images/DSC00034.JPG" alt="" /></p>
<p>Yes, that's the whole RPMforge team for you.</p>
<p>A bunch of us headed out to De Appel in Leuven for Drinks an Food.<br />
I drove back Luke and Karanbir to their hotels only to get stuck in traffic in Brussels.</p>
<p>I was looking forward to <a href="http://isecom.org/">Pete Herzog's talk on OSSTMM</a> on Sunday morning,  it feels like ages ago since I was closely involved in the OSSTMM project , I had a 2 minute chat with Pete before he flew back to Barcelona but it was worth getting up early .  If I could find that  26hoursaday patch I'd probably jump back into it.</p>
<p>Max Spevack finished his Future of Fedora talk early so I could still catch the end of <a href="http://buytaert.net/">the Drupal talk</a>  While hurrying back to <a href="http://wraptastic.org/">Jeff Johnsons</a> talk on the current state of RPM  , I bumped into Roland,  JJ talked a lot about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/xar/">xar</a> , also something to look into.</p>
<p>Before Lance could start his CentOS roadmap talk I ran into Lenz and Roland but couldn't find them again after I finished my sandwich :(</p>
<p>One of the talks that  I will be remembering was <a href="http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/">stpeter's</a> 1 slide per second talk.  Great stuff.. really kept you focussed and meaningful content also, not just marketing crap.  Only too bad he didn't provide a ful solution yet.  Time wil..</p>
<p>Fosdem kept the best for last,  Luke's Puppet talk, I've mentoinned puppet before in this blog,  so you kind of know why I keep mentionning this.<br />
I taped his whole talk with my mobile.  The video quality isn't really good, but the sound is reasonable. I should probably check with Luke to put it online somewhere in a usable format ;)</p>
<p>After Luke's talk I went home and started the recovery process , which took till ..  well.. now :)</p>
