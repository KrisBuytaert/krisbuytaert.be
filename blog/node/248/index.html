<div class="content">
<div id="node-248" class="node  story">
<div class="content"><p>After a great social event spending some time talking to LMB about quagga and HA and other stuff we headed to a local Irish pub to finish the evening.<br />
As some people had trouble finding their way to the hotel  but were still on time for their own<br />
talk I must conclude it was about time we hit the sheets ;)</p>
<p>Ted Tso gave us a nice overview of the Linux development model.  After the break I headed for the Linux HAv2 session by Lars , One CRM to rule them all.. how can one possibly  think this talk<br />
would be about Customer Relationship Managers and not about Cluster Resource Managers :), had a<br />
good laugh on that one.</p>
<p>Then Matt was up for the talk about openQRM, it must have been my bad Karma coz even tough he he had tested his laptop on the projector before his talk as I had suggested,  the thing didn't work and broke down even with different laptops.<br />
So Matt had to give his presentation with the audience watching his laptop screen.</p>
<p>As the projector troubles delayed the talk for about 20 minutes I quickly ran off to spagetti with Peter as  we wanted to be in time for the next presentation<br />
Ralph on SELinux vs Apparmor,  his LinuxTag talk was in German, this one luckily in English ..<br />
good summary ,, got to to read that paper again for a good summary, but the projector still was<br />
broken and we had to move to s smaller room for the last couple of talks.</p>
<p>Marcel  then treated us to an old skool hardware hacking with irda and other fun tools good for<br />
some really good laugh with the lack of security in your average hotel room.  By the time we recovered from the laughter Maddog lined up to close the conference and tell us more than we ever wanted to know about Finish Sauna habits.</p>
<p>Yet another great linuxkongress , and after a  6 hour drive home , I just arrived minutes away from saturday :)</p>
<p>Next conference  stop  LinuxWorldExpo Utrecht</p>
