  <h2 id="title">Open Source Days 2008 , Day 2 </h2>
<div class="content">
<div id="node-739" class="node  blog">
<div class="content"><p>As I was already up since yesterday 0500 , it was dinner with Sven , Robin and some other conference visitors at a Turkish Buffet place , after which we headed to what seemed to be a great bar where they failed to serve us while waiting for over 10 minutes, so we moved on to another place. and then to be "early"</p>
<p>After walking around a bit in Copenhagen and looking for a bus stop to go to the university I managed to bump into Wim &amp; Co who offered me a ride to the IT University. Where I was almost in time for the first talk by<br />
Jan Wieck about Slony-I,  A master to multiple slaves-replication system for PostgreSQL<br />
Given my recent MySQL MultiMaster setups I was fairly interested where PostgreSQL is at today.</p>
<p>Jan started out with explaining where he used replication the most,<br />
For backups and    Specialized services  so he could offload long running and intrusive reporting tools to an isiolated server.</p>
<p>While going over the history of Slony he also mentioned eRserver, first written in Perl later  rewritten  in Java and that was a ...   Well lets just say that memory usage wasn't really ideal.</p>
<p>The presentation covered different potential replication scenarios and the problems one could run into.<br />
No sign however of multimaster replication.  Jan Wieck even told us he had no plans to implmenent multimaster replication<br />
at all at the moment.   To me MultiMaster means that I can move my database connection together with my application service in a HA setup.  I don't need to wory about the possibility of writing in a slave and breaking replication  as the slave is also a master and the other node Will catch up.</p>
<p>Next up was a talk about openID, which made me realize a couple of things about it..  all off that in a separate post :)</p>
<p>The University restaurant was open and you could pay for your Chilli Con Carne to a really Grumpy cashier which brings me right to the next talk I followed..  A Developers Guide to Grumpy Old Sysadmins however, the majority of people in the room were Sysadmins , or people with a mixed role doing both development and sysadmin work.</p>
<p>You don't let your developers even close to your production systems.  He then went on to read a fairly big part of "Over Clocked,  Stories of the Future Present " by Cory Doctorow ,  which I've  promptly put on my holliday reading list :</p>
<p>So what's it like being a sysadmin ?  You get calls in the middle of the night because a system breaks,<br />
When you work you .. people complain when things go wrong.. they don't cheer when things go right or when you have done your job correctly</p>
<p>Reminds me of this situation at a customer where the Cisco people that fail to automate their work and  get to travel around the qworld to do  their work using their serial console , where as the Linux platform team has automated their work so far they get to stay home and watch the machines boot  then do a quick check over ssh to see if they actually work.</p>
<p>Anyhow.. the talk really wasn't focusing on how developers could cooperate better with sysadmins, apart from a couple of general tips  so it really missed its goal.</p>
<p>I popped into the Lightning talk about Ubuntu on EEE talk , hoping to learn something, apart from 1 url that I should read I guess it was the otherway around  , it's usually a bad sign when a speaker starts every 2 slides with "I haven't tested this myselve but " ...</p>
