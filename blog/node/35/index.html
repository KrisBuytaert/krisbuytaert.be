  <h2 id="title">UKUUG Day 1</h2>
<div class="content">
<div id="node-35" class="node  story">
<div class="content"><p>I first went to the "Experiences of a large linux deployment in<br />
education." talk of which the title already got changed to "a linux<br />
deployment",  no  sign  of  the large part :( Which was rather<br />
dissapointing for me. However the talk was interesting anyway. They<br />
mainly discussed thin client solutions using LTSP. With 1 server<br />
they serve about 35 users. (dual cpu 4Gb) Using blade servers (IBM)<br />
only for standardisation reasons.</p>
<p>They had a relevant complaint about Memory utilisation of both<br />
OpenOffice,  Gnome  and  KDE, where's the time when we squezed everything into 4Kb :)</p>
<p>Moving to adopting a driver where Matthew Wilcox explained how you<br />
can end up maintaining a subsystem and called for more volunteers :)</p>
<p>Linux and ACPI, a brave new world of power management, a good and<br />
detailed explanation of why ACPI is so difficult, where's the time<br />
that VGA mode was really VGA mode (just set a couple of registers and int 13h right ? )</p>
<p>System Tap, rerun of an OLS 2005 talk , it introduces a new tool to<br />
diagnose complex system problem while not having to rebuild / reboot<br />
your environment too much. It's based on the kprobes infrastructure<br />
and not only aimed at kernel developers alone ;)</p>
<p>Lunch, great lunch, som curries with rice, nice .. reminds me of the<br />
Lunches at LinuxKongress and the Pizza party at LCA.</p>
<p>BSD Talk about Mitigating Security , somehow this reminds me of the<br />
RedHat security talk at Fudconf 2005 Linux, well, at least some of<br />
the parts do :)</p>
<p>Missed Bdale's talk at linux.conf.au .. and now I finally know what<br />
bouncing of the moon is :) The most interresting part of the talk is<br />
the  reason why people have been working so hard on gnu radio,<br />
because  this way they prevent legislation to disallow them to<br />
reverse engineer hdtv since there already is an open source version   available that can display it.</p>
<p>On to OpenStreetMap.com , Steve Coast claims to be the new Wikipedia<br />
for but then for Maps, just as wikipedia was after their first year<br />
they have a good starting point that contains some usefull maps and<br />
with the help of the community it will grow, maybe I should hook up a GPS to my car and start feeding them some info. We need more<br />
detailed freely available maps of Antwerp and surroundings :)</p>
<p>Napi talk from Jamal Hadi Salim , with some benchmarking regardingNapi.</p>
<p>Now am I asleep or did I just see Christoph having to use Jamals<br />
laptop cause his Powerbook doesn't wan't to work on the projector ?<br />
Anyway we can sleep safe since Christoph just confirmed that he is<br />
not a spy working for Sco (anymore):)</p>
<p>Seems like a hughe amount of presentations are having problems with<br />
the projectors ;( There is some urgent need for people to fix this.</p>
<p>After the Conference Dinner, we had Dave Miller giving the Keynote ,<br />
he gave a nice overview of Netconf, on who is doing what, what we'll<br />
see in the new kernels. I've got no notes as I was trying to make sure Dave didn't fall over my feet while giving his talk, and I<br />
usually don't run around with my laptop at conference dinners :)</p>
