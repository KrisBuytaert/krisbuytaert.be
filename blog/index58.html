  <div class="content"><p>Every once in a while you start with something new..   you're used to being rather expercienced on different topics in open source , having written an article and a book left or right  but there comes a day when you will feel a total newbie again :)</p>
<p>About 10 years ago I was mostly into technical webdevelopment , perl, php, oracle plsql , java servlets  , coldfusion stuff like that.. I stopped building corporate websites about 7-8 years ago when I realised I was spending more time helping people to build the infrastructure to host those sites than actually building the sites. (That and the fact that I really got bored with people wanting greener green)</p>
<p>So fast forward to about 5-6 months ago where I suddenly felth the need again to start writing code for a small pet project of mine.</p>
<p>I wanted a framework where I could jumpstart with different features I needed such as usermanagement  and a blog feature.</p>
<p>As I mentionned earlier this week .. everybody seems to be using Drupal these days and has similar  newbie feelings :)</p>
<p><a href="http://dag.wieers.com/blog/content/mistakes-made-when-using-drupal-personal-blog" rel="nofollow">Dag </a> is posting about his experiences on how to use Drupal as a personal blog.     So my current project is different.</p>
<p>For a personal blog I wouldn't be using the blog module either has he describes, but as I wanted different authors .. I understood I do need it.</p>
<p>I had the same problem with the Vocabularies and Terms .. Upon starting I really didn't understand what they meant for my blog.  So I recreated the categories I had in dotclear in there.    I deleted them from my database after a month, when I figured out how to use tagging in the blog :)</p>
<p>So what do you need when you want to go one step further, like getting content from a database.  So here is where the I probably went totally wrong and where the documentation could use a hand.</p>
<p>I started out writing my own module where I use some drupal functions and custom php code.  Turns out there is something like CCK but I`m still not sure if CCK is the thing I need (or how to use it)</p>
<p>I`m pretty sure the way I`m writing my modules totally wrong also.<br />
I'm having 1 big file in which I do everything.. Pretty crappy if you ask me but I don't really find another way .. Or should I create multiple modules ?</p>
<p>Luckily this is <cite>just a hobby, won't be big and professional like</cite>...  It's just a project to  learn and I got a different dayjob ..<br />
However my fear is that other people probably won't realize how wrong the<br />
are using a certain technology and will offer their services to customers :(</p>
<p>So I`m nagging some people about a new Drupal User group meeting.<br />
Guess Dag and I will learn some stuff there ;)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Lots of new and interresting stuff on the web these days.</p>
<p>First of all the Centos community has a <a href="/blog/planet.centos/index.html">planet.centos.org</a> now. Were I ran into the brand new feed of <a href="http://dag.wieers.com/blog" rel="nofollow"> Field Commander Wieers</a> Dag was long overdue setting up a blog but he finally made it and  he already pointed me to interresting stuff :)</p>
<p>Then there is <a href="http://www.vandenabeele.com/blog" rel="nofollow">Peter Vandenabeele</a> who also decided to start up a blog.  </p>
<p>And last but not least I ran into <a href="http://dev2ops.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Dev2Ops</a> , upon sending that link to a collegue he asked me if I was behind that site ..  I`m not :)</p>
<p>Dev2Ops clearly is tackling the stuff I`m involved with on a daily base.  How do you deploy and upgrade software and it's configuration for different similar machines in the field.<br />
The have a couple of nice polls on their site  which interrest me:<br />
<a html>   How do you disribute software releases for in-house developed applications?</a> and <a href="http://dev2ops.blogspot.com/2007/09/poll-how-do-you-maintain-system.html" rel="nofollow"> How do you maintain<br />
system configuration files?</a>. Just go a head and vote .  I`m interrested in the results.<br />
My votes were on using pacakges (rpm/deb) using apt or yum and off course Puppet ! ;)</p>
<p>BTW.. It makes me wonder .. who is NOT using Drupal these days :))</p>

<p>The first number of guesses were pretty obvious.  Different people tought I was heading to Xensource,   other people tought I was heading for Qumranet.<br />
Other people tought I was heading to the US.<br />
I'd love to spend some time abroad working in a  different culture so who knows  one day..</p>
<p>But I`m pretty much not moving that far yet<br />
Our new venture is called Inuits.  I write our as there are different  familiar faces at <a href="/blog/www.Inuits/index.html">Inuits</a></p>
<p>Our website isn't ready yet .. we have other priorities.<br />
But as soon as it's ready I`ll let you know </p>

  <div class="content"><p>Don Marti is bloging on <a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/community/?q=node/1429" rel="nofollow">Linuxworld</a> how he thinks Qumranet has a future, just not the future they might be looking at now.</p>
<p>Don claims that a software project will fail if someone orders a tool to be used that he himselve is never going to use,  as he will never figure out what features are important and which ones are just irrelevant.    People who actually use the software should be able to decide.  </p>
<p>He gives a good pointer to where MySQL is heading and where they came from.    Typically an organisation did't decide on using MySQL after a zillion meetings an  a couple of purchacing procedures before to  run out to the shop and buy it.  No, people just needed a working rockstable database, they took what they had available, started using it and were pretty happy about it.</p>
<p>That's where opensource easily gained acceptance over the past decade,  but how will the future go when more and more incompetent mangers will have to decide on keep throwing money out of the window for licenses of products that their people don't use or as an alternative have their people choose , waste less money and go home with a bigger bonus at the end of the year.   We'll nobody has ever been fired for buying useless software right ? </p>
<p>I've read people claiming that Qunranet is going to compete with Xensource,  I wonder how,  Yes they are both in the virtualisation market,   but for me they are in two totally different but complementary areas  At least Don understands that  I wonder, does he know what they are up to or is he just  really or has he just a smart guy with some good ideas  on the future.</p>

  <div class="content"><p><a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/wim/2007/09/20#a56" rel="nofollow">Seklos</a> just posted a story on his Oracle blog on how he installed Oracle 10something in less than an hour.</p>
<p>I found the story hilarious.  why .  because about a decade ago .. when I was still into database &amp; webdevelopment, Oracle first started shipping Oracle for Linus (somewhere in 99)<br />
Back then some collegue  had been struggling for a couple of days already to setup up Oracle on a Windows box and was thinking to just use SQL server.<br />
So I went home found the famous CD with the typo (or did I really get the CD that should have been shipped to Finland ?) in my mailbox and as I had a new Siemens Server sitting in my basement, I installed a fresh RedHat and on a machine I never had seen before (that's the ninetees I`m talking about so no fancy just install it on most common hardware and it will work like we have these days)  and then went on installing an Oracle version I had never seen before and guess what .. I completed that task in about just less than an hour.<br />
So when I arrived at the office the next morning with an up and running Oracle on Linux server the crowd didn't believe me untll they fired up their SQLPlus clients and started creating their tablespaces and tables.</p>
<p>So now about 8 years later it still takes an experienced Linux and Oracle guy about an hour to install a basic Oracle ? What have they been doing ? </p>
<p>I bootstrap a fully operational MySQL server from blank disk to replying to queries in about 5 minutes.<br />
Maybe I  should  move back to Oracle because as a consultant I get paid by the hour and if a similar job takes me about 10 times as long as I`m used to .. can you imagine ..</p>
<p>Now all joking aside .. the problem isn't with Oracle, the problem isn't with RedHat and not all the solutions are with MySQL, the problem is with people with little or no system experience trying to do a job they should grow in to over time, and failing to get proper help or guidance their first time.</p>
<p>Just one final thought.. with Unbreakable I really would have expected Oracle to go one step further not requiring the runInstaller thing anymore but just providing their customers with  cleanly packaged software so a yum or apt-get install oracle would actually work.</p>
<p>Because as <a href="http://madstop.com/" rel="nofollow">Luke</a> learned us . <cite>If your computer can't install it .. the installation procedure is broken.</cite></p>
