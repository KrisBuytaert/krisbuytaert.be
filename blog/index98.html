So here's a first hint .. lots of mozilla related stuff in the tarbal, so it's a browser... with some extras..<br />
Ok ..Let's have a loser look .. you need a blog, <a href="http://del.icio.us/kbuytaert">a del.icio.us acount</a> and hmm.. that's it..   ok , that's not too much asked.  Right so now I`m sharing bookmarks ..<br />
Ok So flock integrates with del.icio.us for my bookmarks.  But since I don't have a "compliant" blog , I can't use it's other features..</p>
<p>Still wondering why this is in <a href="http://www.decrem.com/bart/">Belgian Open source work</a> ?</p>
<p>Well, they didn't get me as a new user yet .. I'll be looking again at new releases .. this looks interresting but it's not world shocking.. Yet</p>

However we ran into some pictures of early Linux events in Belgium,  according to Fets it was in 1993</p>
<p>It was actually one of the first Linux info sessions held at the,  InfoGroup at the VUB , upon arriving there I realised that the VUB was not going to be the place where I would study</p>

With a full week vacation in a sunny environment behind me I finally catched up on some urgent reading.<br />

It depicts corporate america as a bunch of idiots who pick up the phone and hand out confidential information to any moron who calls them.<br />
The sad part is that it is probably nothing less than the truth, giant corporations are an easy target for crackers that dare to pick up their phones and so are governements.<br />
The question is what kind of tricks they use to get into  smaller companies.  Anyway I spent a good time laughing with the stories which was afterall whta I planned on reading the book for.<br />
The book contains a template for a security policy,  the question if that policy was available under some free documentation license to be reused and modified by other people however still remains unanswerred.</p>
<p>I`ll be posting the other reviews later this week :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>So I've catched up with my reports on LinuxKonference in Hamburg, it was great as always :)  I still haven't catched up with reporting on lots of reading I have been doing lately :)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.x-tend.be/~fred/">Fred</a>  is off to <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/eurooscon/">Euroscon</a> to give a talk about Mobile Tin laptops.<br />
And I`m about to finish up on some code so I can finally put it online , clean up my presentation and paper so those can finaly be put online, and start working on openMosix at 2.6 again :)<br />
Next to that I still have some work to do getting my PVR working, I also need to get the scanning part of our new HP All In one printer working (Till told me over dinner last week it should work so.. I need to make some time) and there is an IBM openpower 720 lying around at the office that I needs to be tested , SystemImager and LVM needs some testing<br />
Oh did I mention I still need to get some work done during daytime also ? , the above mentionned stuff is only the fun stuf :)</p>

            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>Woke  up a bit later, but still managed to get in time for the presentations.</p>
<p>I started the morning with Jeffrey Moyer's talk about Automounter, then I Catched up on some mailreading, figured out the default gw<br />
for wireless so I can actually read my mail in the talks :) Then   continued with the Logfs talk from Jorn Engel , the thing that's<br />
probably still the most annyoing about specialised filesystems for  Flash is that we might be using them in some Linux based projects but the rest of the planet will continue using fat16 or some other antique type.<br />
Our camera's and the USB disks we share with other people still are in a wrong type.  I've been using different filesystems on my usb stick but the moment you want to copy something you have to create another filesystem on it.</p>
<p>Then went on to Harald's update on Netfilter which I should actualy have skipped since I knew lots of stuff from it David Millers Keynote at the UKUUG already well, at least it all sounded familiar :), I should have gone to Ben Martins talk :) I learned about  <a href="http://ozlabs.org/~jk/projects/nfsim/">nfsim , the Netfilter Simuation Environment</a>  however.</p>
<p>I opted for Volker's Clustered Samba talk.  Lots of stuff in Clustering samba seems like it has already been done before in other<br />
Clustering environments however the moment you realise that this stuff  also has to work on about some totally other platforms such as Solaris,<br />
HP/UX and AIX and also on top of different filesystems. Quoting Lars(MB)  on that topic: "You have my sympathy" Always interresting to see<br />
audience feedback from people such as Lars and Alan who actually   give  valuable  input to a speaker who learns during his talk.<br />
Everybody seems to be testing stuff on GFS/GPFS but not that many  people are using OCFS2 yet, at least that how it sounded in Hamburg. Volker has been doing GFS / GPFS<br />
testing, Philip told us yesterday that he didn't have time yet to do   OCFS2  testing,  he acutally mentionned that it was because he couldn't get it to work in 1 day, so he dropped it.</p>
<p>The conference closes with a Future of Linux Distributions discussion , opening with the question "Are there to many distributions and isthis a problem ?" Joey, of debian security fame, notes that we might need to look at why people start  working  on  different  Distributions,  are the currentdistributions not listening enough  ?  Off course some distributions have their own specific goal, but a fork just for the reason of forking or just to be able "I maintain my own linux distribution (wich is used by me, my grandmother and my niece)" , that shouldn't happen.</p>
<pre></pre><p>There was some discussion going on about what's still missing in Linux,  with suggestions ranging from Process migration , which obviously already exists for ages as in the form of the <a href="http://openmosix.sf.net/">openMosix</a> project  trough automated system management tools.  (I`m still wondering on which planet the guy who asked for those has been living for the past say .. 5 years.)</p>
<p>Headed back to the hotel and then into Hamburg City to eat .. a Hamburger with some other .be people</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Yesterday evening was the speaker dinner it was in some Turkish<br />
restaurant near the conference venue .. I was sitting with some of<br />
the Xen people and Till "I kill the Rainforest" Kampetter , some<br />
interresting  stuff has been talked about..I bailed out "early<br />
because of my talk today .. "</p>
<p>Keynote time, Olaf Kirch on the past and the future of the linux<br />
kernel. In his Dear Santa letter we noticed NFSv5. What is NFS v5 ?<br />
He goes on discussing the end of binary only modules, one day there<br />
will be a "big bang" and we won't be allowing binary kernel modules<br />
anymore, this won't be such a problem since mostly only 3D stuff<br />
isn't relevant anyway ;).</p>
<p>Olaf's tells us that he knows that his week is ruined when on Monday<br />
morning he gets a mail "Very Important Customer reports bad NFS<br />
performance. Please fix immediately" It shouldn't be since the obvious and easy fix is probably vi /etc/hosts .</p>
<p>During the break Alan ran up to me and made some remark about my  Everything is a Fscking DNS T-Shirt I should have traded it for a HAt :)<br />
Alan is giving his regular "Why do you need Linux-HA", and We (the  open source people) can afford HA since we haven't spent an arm and a leg to expensive software and hardware introduction It's all about "Blame" management. He then goes on describing the new features in   LinuxHA v2, build-in resource monitoring, sophisticated dependency   model where you can even define dependencies on remote machines or   constraints that define resource you don't want to see together on the same machines, or resources that have to be on the same machine.   Time dependent constraints such as only failback during such and such time, but failover when it is required. Resource management   becomes more important, I should have a closer look at OCF, the   Resources will have multiple states, started-as-slave, started as master, stopped, running etc.. About complexity: Isn't the v2 model   significantly more complex than the v1 model ? LMB answers : you   should    see    it    as   more   consulting   opportunities.</p>
<p>As  everybody keept telling it as time to drop the 0. from the  version number or DRBD , so DRBD made a hughe version step from 0.7  to 8. As a shared storage box is is a SPOF we obviously prefer a  shared nothing environment, DRBD enables this for us.   The most important new feature in DRBD: Shared disk semantics Allow   both nodes RW access to mirrored storage. Usefull for shared disk   file GFS, OCFS2, GPFS  It seems that theperformance cutback for using DRBD is only 4%   (according to Bonnie) , supporting up to 4TB -128Mb :) A commercial   DRBD, DRBD+, version is now also available from Linbit. A DRBD   version pre 8 is about to be released when Philip gets back from the   conference.</p>
<p>Csync2 , a nice feature is adding triggers to the event of a file   transfer, e.g an apache restart could be triggerd after an apache   config file has been modified. It uses a database sqlite to store  it's metadata which makes it a bit heavier than one might want the   environment.</p>
<p>Csync2 looks to me (and Clifford) as a good tool to keep a simple   cluster's config/data files in sync. Not as a way to manage your   infrastructure or as a replacement for cfengine. Another difference   is that csync2 uses a meshed architecture as opposed to a central   repository in Cfengine.</p>
<p>Gerd Knorr gave a good overview of Xen which was very well attended  even while he was scheduled next to Harald who usually atracts full<br />
auditoria. Having seen Ian giving his Xen talk in Swansea already there wasn't that much new in it for me.</p>
<p>Then there was some speaker with stuff about how to deploy  Xen in large environments. I already knew most of that stuff hmm.. Been there , done that .. gave the talk :)</p>
<p>Just before the boattrip to Social Event in the museum of work there was a talk about Freenigma which a lot of people missed since they<br />
wanted to go back to the hotel first (including me). The social  event location reminded me of the Linux.conf.au delegates session venue, it's a great concept to combine "technology"museum visits    with a social event. Nils Magnus announced that LinuxTag will be getting more support from GUUG and moves to Wiesbaden next year, as    Germany is totally in Football chaos during June it will also be   early May for a change.</p>
