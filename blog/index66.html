<p>We'd probably need some kind of whois++ with authentication.  A one time user registration creates a key, with that key you can query as much as you like.<br />
But DNS.be still keeps control over who's querying.  Abusers can be disconnected.</p>
<p>Would that be a better solution than a Captcha ?</p>

  <div class="content"><p>At last,  so when back in november 2005 I first ran into Fon , I ranted on them not documenting how to install their software on a standard Linux box , seems like now they have these kind of tutorials/packages e.g for Mandrake.</p>
<p>Time passed and while I initially had downloaded their source code and planned on documenting and building my own fon platform with my existing firewall and accesspoint, by magic Last week I won a WRT54GL at the NLUUG Conference.</p>
<p>So here's the documentation for dummies :)<br />
After boot the device, you  connect a machine to it and get an ip from the device. Then you can go to the webinterface , no username password admin.<br />
From there you can go and upload the Firmware you downloaded.<br />
Wait. , Reboot.</p>
<p>I think my Linksys lived about 5 minutes with it's original Firmware :)</p>
<p>At that time you can retry to connect to the device again via a new dhcpd lease.<br />
You'll get a totally new application, this time your router is running Linux powered by Fon.   Configure all your stuff then connect via a wirelles device to it, get a lease, then try surfing to the outer world.  Fon will redirect you to their site where you can choose between becoming a Bill or a Linus,  off course you want to become a Linus.<br />
From there you can start adding friends and configuring your homepage. Off you go.. now you are a Fonero !</p>
<p>PS.  I've got 3  Fon  gets Fonero invitations left providing you with a Fon router for 20 euro.</p>

            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>I finally got time again to look at ZoneMinder .  As my ElCheapo webcams are supported now in recent kernels it was time to give ZoneMinder another try.</p>
<p>I started of from a Fresh FC6 install , upgraded the kernel, then ran into <a href="http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=154003">this</a>  article telling me to get ffmpeg-devel and some other packages.  I took them from atrpms.  5 minutes later I ran into a build failure that showed up 3 google hits but no result.<br />
(Too bad I forgot to save the error somewhere)</p>
<p>Then I ran into <a href="http://www.wains.be/index.php/2007/04/24/installing-zoneminder-1223-under-centos-44/">Sebastien Wains  Installing ZoneMinder 1.22.3 under CentOS 4.4</a><br />
Not that much different from the other howto, apart from where you have to get ffmpeg etc.<br />
I got the ffmpeg packages from the Dries /RPMForge repository.  And then off course ZoneMinder builds like a charm.</p>
<p>I hadn't noticed that SELinux was enabled on the box (<a href="http://www.x-tend.be/~kb/blog/index.php?2007/03/20/341-simon-said">I usually disable it</a> )    which kept me from having an instant working setup.  But one reboot and SELinux disable later we're up and running.</p>
<p>As of now I`ll know which Cat to punish for bringing in (dead) mice and birds !</p>

          <span class="author">By: Kris Buytaert</span>
            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>As you can see I`m lagging on blog postings , there is still lost of stuff I want to talk about but I fail to find enough time to write down my ideas.  Almost 2 weeks ago the NLUUG Spring conference was held in Ede,  this years topic was Virtualisation.  As mentionned earlier I was invited to talk about Using openQRM to manage Virtual Machines, with Xen in particular.</p>
<p>The day started with <a href="http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/">Joanna Rutkowska</a> talking about Blue Pill the conecpt of moving a running operating system un the fly into a virtual machine, and the impact on security for these machines.  She started off with a fairly technical talk which I`m sure that not everybody in the audience understood, so gi<br />
ven the early hour lots of them dozed off..  Too bad the occasional security joke was only noticed by few :(</p>
<p>The next talk was the one from Vitaly Wool who got swapped with the one from Frank Weyns,  As a former MontaVista employee Vitaly dicussed the reasons for userland drivers in an embedded environment.  If you think about the fact that different mobile phones today still are running different operating systems on different cpu's , think what virtualisation in this area could do.</p>
<p>After my own talk and the Lunch break Anil Madhavapeddy was up to give us an update on the current state of Xen<br />
Anil at that time he told us that 3.0.5 could happen any time now.. which in the meanwhile has happened in the form of 3.1 The weird thing is that every time I see Anil giving a talk he has a new release ready :)<br />
Maybe I should meet with him more often :)<br />
He also gave us an overview of the interresting stuff that had just happened at the XenSummit and information on the Xen Roadmap</p>
<p>Obviously I staid in the maintrack to see Avi Kivity present his work on KVM, I'd probably have come to this confere<br />
nce as a visitor just to see this talk if I hadn't been a speaker.</p>
<p>I Skipped Franks and the BSD talk, then tried to sneak into the Using Xen talk but it was so crowded and from the hallpath I could see there wasn't going to be much to be learned for me.</p>
<p>Asia Slowinska  closed the day with a talk on Prospector, or how she used Qemu based virtual machines to analyse Sta<br />
ck Overflows,  fairly interresting stuff .</p>
<p>Tim and I wondered "Do you have to be female in order to be interrested in both Virtualisation and Security ?"<br />
I haven't seen that many women giving such technical talks at conferences,  this was something totally different fro<br />
m Creating new tracks in TuxRacer. (which also was a great talk btw)</p>
<p>The Drink after the conference had a nice surprise for me.  There was a contest which Tim Hemel and I seemed to had won where Tim got an MP3 player and I got a Linksys WRT54GL.  More about that new toy in a later post.</p>
<p>As I didn't want to get stuck in traffic hungry I had gladly  accepted to join the rest of the speakers for the conference dinner.  I`m not used to quality food in the Netherland so I wasn't expecting much but I was quite surprised with the quality of "Het Oude Politiebureau" in Ede.</p>
<p>Anyway the Virtualisation conference was some time well spent !</p>
