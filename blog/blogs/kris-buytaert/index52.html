  <div class="content"><p>I spent way too much time this weekend trying to get the <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/file/includes/pager.inc/5" rel="nofollow">pager</a> stuff in Drupal working for a module I`m playing with.  </p>
<p>I had learned a lot from the watchdog module on how paging was supposed to be working and I was trying to do the same with another database.    As I got a page limited by the number of records I wanted but I couldn't find any of the fancy next, previous and page number thingies that I wanted.    </p>
<p>The watchdog module worked for me and I started stripping the watchdog module till I could actually replace my function with watchdog_overview function.    Even replaced the watchdog query with my qeury..  but not such luck.. I couldn't get   $output .= <span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text">theme('pager', NULL, 50, 0);</code></span>  to work.</p>
<p>So as every open source geek does.. I started looking into the code.  pager.inc<br />
The header told me  the author.. I could mail him and wait or even call him , , but I read on.<br />
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text">$pager_total_items[$element] = db_result(db_query($count_query, $args));</code></span><br />
Never returned  anything useful.., my mysql log learned me there never was any query with a count ..<br />
Till I modified the pager.inc file to actually perform the query I wanted it to do.. and it started working.<br />
Then I took a closer look at the regexp that was being used to create the $count_qeury<br />
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text">$count_query = preg_replace(array('/SELECT.*?FROM /As', '/ORDER BY .*/'), array('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ', ''),$query);</code></span><br />
However my query was all in lowercase so the count was never inserted.</p>
<p>The only difference between the working watchdog module and my own code was in the use of uppercase SQL statements.<br />
So call me lazy :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p><a href="http://arjen-lentz.livejournal.com/98238.html" rel="nofollow">Arjen</a> wonders why the MySQl Cluster Study book is published on Lulu and not trough MySQL 's traiditional publisher.</p>
<p>Altough I was involved in the creation process of the mentionned book, I have no idea why this decision was made but to me it makes perfect sense.   MySQL Cluster is a piece of software that is still going to change a lot in the next couple of months and years.<br />
A book published in a traditional way needs a minimal sales volume in order to be worth publishing.  If there even is a slight chance that by the time the book gets published a significant amount of content of the book has already changed traditional publishers shouldn't publish the book. Now over at Lulu.com a book won't be print before a customer orders it.  So when the book is being sent to me.   I get the current version of the book..   If in 3 months the authors decide to rewrite a chapter or make some bugfixes.   The book can be updated much faster.<br />
I can imagine that people buying the same title in april next year will already get bugfixes on the version that will arrive at my doorstep in a couple of days.      </p>
<p>At least that's why I would publish a technical book on Lulu.</p>

  <div class="content"><p><a href="http://tarrysingh.blogspot.com/2007/12/10-or-100-virtualization-vendors-to.html" rel="nofollow">Tarry</a> is pointing us to a couple of companies that he thinks we should watch  in the Virtualization area next year.</p>
<p>He's right.. these are exactly the kind of companies we will watch die fast in the next couple of years.   All proprietary vendors,  placing a bet on becoming the next datacenter integrator are are placing their money on the wrong side of evolution.</p>
<p>Why on earth would a sane IT manager want to  bet his infrastructure on a 3rd party tool that implements on top of a proprietary vendor ?  Because he wants to be locked into an infrastructure where he looses control over what he wants to be running ?  Does he want an environment  where he will be forced to puzzle together functionality he really wants by trying to integrate different proprietary vendors that won't play along ?</p>
<p>Heck haven't we learned enough over the last decades .. the key to growth is interoperability and openness.  That's how the web was build .. it wasn't build buy 100 proprietary software vendors setting up a different service you could talk to with different fat management client all trying to accomplish the same features.</p>
<p>If you still haven't understood that .. please move one ... but don't bother me.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Over the past couple of days  there is an increased flow of traffic to my Inbox all fairly identical mails from people that I`m connected to on LinkedIn that somehow are being invited by their friends to also start using Plaxo.<br />
I`m wondering if people don't realise they are resending their whole LinkedIn addressbook an invitation or if they do it on purpose. I`m still looking for the great new feature that Plaxo has that urges me to switch to it or even consider using it actively.<br />
I haven't found it .. so please explain me why you are using plaxo </p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I started this poll on my blog so people could vote on their social network site.<br />
Guess what the conclusion was.. the majority of my readers favours LinkedIn, some like Facebook and only some individuals like Plaxo or Xing </p>
<p>Yes I create accounts on most new YASN (Yet Another Social Network)  thingies, but merely as a form of Online Identity Protection.  (It's pretty easy to find a new YASN and create an account there that you shouldn't be creating) </p>
<p>Now I`m all in favour of redundancy and high availability.  But I frequently just export my LinkedIn connections to my local desktop and that gives me a nice backup.       </p>
<p>So is this going to be the new trend ?  I launch a new YASN  and suddenly I create an avalanche of mails that will be send to other people.   Geez.. this looks like a virus in LookOut<br />
But how long wil our email system live if more and more people start using these tools and more and more new sites implement the feature. ?  When will Inbox protection tools start  with default filtersets for a list of Social Networks ?<br />
Wil social networks start to figure out ways to evade Inbox protection tools ?</p>
<p>Maybe we just need to add some more meta information in our DNS servers.  :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>So while shopping for a new Timesheet application, last month we tried to use eHour.   We tried, and have already stopped our evaluation.</p>
<p>Our requirements are pretty simple.   A bunch of consultants need to be able to book their time on different projects.  We need to be able to print out these timesheets for a customer to be able to sign and our financial department needs to be able to print invoices based on the time we spend for the different customers.</p>
<p>Apart from a rather itchy user interface,   a really non straightforward way to add projects or even try to modify them it were mainly<br />
little annoyancies such as not being able to print a timesheet if you only have 1 project you worked on that month, made us look again for alternatives.</p>
<p>Then we ran into <a href="http://blog.ehour.nl/index.php/archives/35" rel="nofollow">this</a> posting on the eHour blog.   eHour indeed had fixed some of the annoyancies we had but decided to close their source again.      Right end of story for us there.</p>
<p>So rather than being able to help out and contribute to a better product, we are now once again in the market to try our next Open Source timesheet app.</p>
