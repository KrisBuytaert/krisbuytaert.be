  <div class="content"><p>My mother suggested that she would babysit while the 2 of us went out to eat yesterday.  The idea was to have a good dinner in one of the restaurants that took part of the <a href="../restaurantweek/index.html">Restaurantweek.be</a> action.</p>
<p>The idea is that you get a 3 course dinner for 25 Euro a person in a good quality restaurant .. therefore no brasserie or pubfood.  With different of the top restaurants of antwerp taking part of the action we decided to pic a new one we didn't know yet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.brancherestaurants.com/" rel="nofollow">Branche Restaurant</a> , which is  the restaurant of the new Golden Tulip Hotel next to the Antwerp Train station.</p>
<p>When we arrived there yesterday we got asked for a voucher for the 2 for 1 action.   We were pretty clueless at that point as we never heard of the 2 for 1 action.  We were there for a culinary action  from Restaurantweek. </p>
<p>The menu for the evening was going to be schrimp salad, pepper steak and tiramisu.     WTF ?   I can make that myselve,  or If I`m hungry and I need to eat that's what I grab in a tavern, that's not what I wan't to have when I go out to eat !</p>
<p>But it was only going to cost us 25 euro for the 2 of us claimed the waiter.<br />
Well.. we had to eat anyhow so why not ..</p>
<p>Somehow they forgot we had ordered one steak well done, and neglected to ask about how the other one.   So we sent the rare steak back to the kitchen.  I actualy had to get up and go ask where it stayed after about 20 minutes.  By then the fries were cold..  so I asked for new ones.. by the time we got those.. the steak was cold.     We got offered a free drink for the delay .. but never saw that drink anyhow.</p>
<p>We had dessert ... and asked for the check ..    obviously I was kind of surprised that they had charged us 2x 25 Euro, unlike  what they had told us upfront.<br />
The waiter explained that he didn't know about the Restaurantweek arrangement and he mistakenly assumed we had the other , the 2 for 1 offer,   the 2 for one offer got that menu for 39 Euros for 2 persons.    And well.. they had given us the same menu for 2x25 euro ..</p>
<p>We weren't there for some cheapo fries and steak in the first place.. we went there for a culinary dish.    And 39 euro's for that menu would have been a big RipOff anyhow.    The only reason why we accepted the offer was because it was damn cheap and we had to eat anyhow.      So now we had had crappy and way to expensive  food,  and bad service as well and we were inadvertedly  informed that most of the tables around us that actually  had the 2for1 offer even paid 10 euro less for the same menu.</p>
<p>Upon asking for a "btwbonneke" the waitress was absolutely clueless, c'mon .. if you work in a restaurant in Belgium you have to know what a 'btw-bonneke' is.<br />
She didn't , luckily her collegue knew.</p>
<p>So Restaurantweek really should have communicated better with their restaurants that people signing up for the offer expect something different from Steak with Fries and a small schrimp salad upfront.</p>
<p>And as for the Branche Restaurant service .. well..   guess you'll never see us again ..  and I gues you'll never see the table that was sitting next to us again either.    The least you should have done was actually give us the menu for 39Euro's like some of the other tables and give us another drink as you had promised anyhow.</p>
<p>But all you got now .. was bad publicity.  But then again .. you won't go bankrupt ..as you are part of a hotel, and a hotel needs a restaurant anyway  so why should you bother in the first place.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>As some of you know I run Fedora on my main Laptop, and Ubuntu on my EEE and my office Desktop.   My Ubuntu installs were pretty fresh, but my fedora was long due for an upgrade.    As after years of abuse (--force --nodeps) it usually is impossible to do a regular upgrade, so my best way out was a quick and fresh install on an isolated root partition.   (my /home/ etc live on separate volumes)</p>
<p><a href="http://raskas.be/" rel="nofollow">Johan</a> tricked me into installing a FC10 x86-64 setup which required some more work than usual, but I`m back in the same state as I was before I started the upgrade.  We'll almost .. as I expect I`ll be reinstalling packages I don't daily use on a frequent basis over the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>I'll dig a bit deeper in my x86_64 struggles later but first I had to tackle the problems I had with stepping my Evolution to a fresh and hopefully more stable version.</p>
<p>Evolution fails to recognise  the fact that I have multiple calendars, or got confused.. anyway .. my calendar was empty and I had to recreate them all and import them again one by one.<br />
Luckily the content was still available in .ics</p>
<p>Also Evolution partly forgot about all my email accounts , it remembered their passwords after recreating them, but not their settings.. well. that is if I managed to recreate them all :)<br />
(If I`m not replying to a mail you sent me sinc last thursday.. I might just have forgotten about that email address ..</p>
<p>On to the x86_64 stuff then.  <a href="http://blog.verwilst.be/" rel="nofollow">Bort</a> pointed me to the<br />
<a href="http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html" rel="nofollow">Adobe Labs site</a> that had a working flash plugin.  The right symlink in my .mozilla/plugins and the first problem was solved.</p>
<p>There's 2 apps from Google that I sometimes abuse,  I don't know why I still use Picasa, there must be plenty of good open source alternatives out there ..  however for Google Earth I don't really have a good alternative.   bot work  (unlike previous Fedora/Googl Earth combinations)</p>
<p>The only thing that annoyed me was Google Earth and selinux  , I had to run some chcon s to solve the problems.</p>

<p>A couple of more frustrations later  and the SELinux config got changed.  Afterall .. Life is to short for SELinux.</p>
<p>A must,  if you used too have Livna , or FreshRPMS is <a href="http://rpmfusion.org/" rel="nofollow">RPMFusion</a> a merger of the old repositories</p>
<p>Skype  seemed to be a bit more difficult.  I tried installing the rpm at first but I failed , then I read  <a href="http://liquidat.wordpress.com/2008/11/27/moving-on-64bit-linux-pulseaudio-fedora-10-and-so-on/" rel="nofollow">some tips</a> which suggested to use yum localinstall skype*.rpm</p>
<p>As I`m more of an apt-get user (yes even on CentOS etc) I don't usually try installing packages that way .. but it worked like a charm.    Skype started,  I could connect to the servers , however a test call  reveals no input sound.  Maybe if I try again with a headset later.</p>
<p>Anyway,  I`m pretty satisfied so far ...</p>
<p>Next step is to get that skype chat integrated in pidgin.. or hope people will realize they have to drop that proprietary tool one day..</p>

<p>I just removed myselve from tomorrows <a href="http://barcampgent2.wikispaces.com/" rel="nofollow">BarcampGent 2</a>  subscription list.</p>
<p>It seems I can make it to most of the "odd" issues of Belgian Barcamps,   I made it to BarcampBrussels, BarcampBrussels3 and the first BarcampGent,  but for the Even Barcamps , Brussels2 and 4 and now Gent2 there always seems to be something that eventually blocks me from going.     Just like with the BXL edition family priorities kicked in.</p>
<p>Anyway .. have fun tomorrow .. I`ll be thinking of you folks<br />

  <div class="content"><p><a href="http://themattreid.com/wordpress/?p=77" rel="nofollow">Matt Reid</a> wants to know what we want in an Open Source MySQL monitoring solution ?</p>
<p>He is working on the second incarnation of Monolith and wants input from the MySQL community.</p>
<p>Now for me the bigger question is if we want an isolated tool that runs stand alone, or a tool which we can integrate it in something we already have.</p>
<p>To me there is a difference between a tool that I want to use to debug my environment, such as Mytop or MySQL Activity Report, in that case I need  some tool that quickly installs with little dependencies and little impact.</p>
<p>On the other side I want a tool that is constantly there, that tells me about trends and performance history.  But there I don't want an isolated toool, I want something fully integrated where I can correlate different measurements  from disk io, memory usage etc , that tool should also tell me about the things that go<br />
 wrong.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.inuits.be/">We</a> did some research earlier this year to figure out the current state of Open Source monitoring tools.  Different tools have a different audience.. some go for the network layer, others take the os level and other even try to go deep inside the applications.</p>
<p>Given that knowledge we even had the  idea  to refocus that research comparing different monitoring tools such as Zabbix, Zenoss, Hyperic and Nagios again but this time with a focus on monitoring MySQL  and submit that as an abstract for the upcoming MySQL conference,  we didn't .. maybe next time.</p>
<p>There's plenty of frameworks already that will allow you to send alerts on all of the occasions you list, or allow you to graph all the values you want.  And yes we want to see those values too.</p>
<p>But do we want yet another tool , yet another URL to browse to or do we want those alerts and graphs  integrated  in an existing tool such as Zabbix, Zenoss or<br />
Hyperic ..  I guess I prefer the integrated approach.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Done</p>
<p>Some of my lower traffic sites were still on an old Drupal 5,  others were at 6.4 and lots of modules were outdated.   So I set out to migrate all the sites to a multisite setup.   I now have a set of shared modules , shared themes and some specific ones .. just as it is meant to be.    And I only have 1 central Drupal instance to upgrade.  Next step is figuring out how to trigger the database upgrades from 1 central place. </p>
<p>Well 2 , ny personal stuff and <a href="http://www.inuits.be/" />our corporate sites</a>, that's the idea.   Personal site is on plain old Drupal 6.6 and for  the corporate one we are thinking to go with <a href="http://www.acquia.com/" rel="nofollow">Acquia Drupal</a>, but we're not sure yet</p>
<p>I've added a new theme, however I can imagine most of you never saw the old one as most of you read this feed in an RSS readers, yet some people nagged me about my lack of style, and as over a decade ago I even won web design contests , something had to be done :)</p>
<p>I moved some blocks left and right and the performance of the site has improved drastically now, mainly slow technorati loading widgets in the left column often blocked loading, that's all gone now.</p>
<p>Also , as some of the commenters on earlier posts complained the main <a href="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/">page</a> has no CSS as it isn't in the CMS.  So my next step is trying to find out a way that I can replace the now manually maintained files build from different includes into a more dynamical setup where I can also have feeds for my Publications and Presentations.</p>
<p>I`m wondering if there is any microformat or so out there for <a href="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/presentations.html">Presentations</a> and <a href="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/publications.html">Publications</a>  that I could use so other people could use that information in other sites.</p>
<p>After that there's just one site left  to migrate.. but that migration won't be for next month  as there is some custom modules involved that need to be ported.</p>
<p>Well.. off to some more content then :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p><a href="http://blog.verwilst.be/">Bort</a> is in to graphs and stats these days, so he was interested in my little Technorati hack.</p>
<p>Lots of us bloggers are using Technorati to track who's joining the discussion on articles we posts.   Technorati gives you details on how many blogs link to you, and how much they link to you and translate that into an Authority rank.   Now what they don't give you is an idea on how that rank evolves.</p>
<p>Technorati also as an API which allows you to get that same information.<br />
As I was explaining the concept of RRDTool to someone a couple of months ago I thought it was a good idea to track a Technorati rank and grab that with RRDTool.</p>
<p>So I wrote a small script that gets the bloginfo data for my blog from Technorati,<br />
parses out the number of inboundblogs  , writes that info to an RRD file and creates a graph from it</p>
<p><div class="geshifilter"><pre class="text geshifilter-text" style="font-family:monospace;"><ol><li style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal;"><div style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal">wget -O $NOW.html  &quot;http://api.technorati.com/bloginfo?key=getyourown&amp;url=www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/&quot;</div></li><li style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal;"><div style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal">VALUE=`cat $NOW.html   | grep inboundblogs  | head -n 1  | sed -e &quot;s/&lt;//g&quot;  | sed -e &quot;s/inboundblogs//g&quot;  | sed -e &quot;s/\///g&quot; | sed -e &quot;s/&gt;//g&quot; | sed -e &quot;s/ //g&quot; `</div></li><li style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal;"><div style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal">rrdtool update technorati.rrd $UNIXNOW:$VALUE</div></li><li style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal;"><div style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal">rrdtool  graph ../public_html/images/technorati.png --start 1218548820  --vertical-label TechnoratiRank DEF</div></li><li style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal;"><div style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal">:myrank=technorati.rrd:rank:AVERAGE   LINE2:myrank#FF0000 -m 2</div></li></ol></pre></div></p>
<p>The result looks like<br />
<img src="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/images/technorati.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see somewhere in week 37 Technorati was pretty much not working.  And 180 days before week 42 my blog got a lot of fresh , but non recurring inbound links.</p>
<p>Now I have a couple of more ideas to build on this.. just no time.. but if you are interested lemme know ..</p>
<p>Anyhow it's all lies, damn lies and statistics ;)</p>
