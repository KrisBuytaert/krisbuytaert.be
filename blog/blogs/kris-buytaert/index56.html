I`m guessing Microslaven but I`m really not sure anymore .. could be Generation X also .</p>
<p>The deep motivations are exactly the reason why we could be in marketing, only we'd probably<br />
really have to believe in a product to market it.   </p>
<li> Yes I want to the world to stop paying a zillion times for the same piece of code, so I want them to use Free software,
</li><li> Yes  I want the computer to do what I say , I want to see why my harddisk is making a noise and I want to be able to kill -9 a process so I use a unix type of sotware.
</li><li> I want to be able to read the code and learn from it
<p>And I want others to do so too.. I want them to realize it is possible... so I`m spreading the word, one person at a time I`m explaining them why they might want to give Free Software a try.   I`m blogging about it.. I`m giving talks on different subsets of the topic around the world.</p>
<p>I`m doing marketing for a product I care about , one that I believe in ...  only it happens to be geeky.</p>
<p>With the lack of internet , computers in general  could there have been another product that I'd be caring about, promoting  and talking about ...  we'll never know..</p>

<p>He finishes his email with <cite><br />
"If you would prefer not to accept my request then please simply ignore this message. It would be very much appreciated if you did not click on the “do not know this person” button. Have a great day and thank you for your time. "</cite></p>
<p>Now why would I want to do that ?  He just spammed me, via LinkedIn, there is only one sensible thing to do and that is report him as a spammer.   What was this guy thinking.. If I send unsollicited mail directly to someone's inbox he'll probably tag it as spam.  If I do it via LinkedIn he`ll like it ? </p>
<p>I only link with people that I have communicated with over different media , know in person , have spoken with on the phone ( a head hunter that calls me doesn't count), worked with in real life  or have worked with online intensively in different open source projects..  there are couple of exceptions in my connections from my early days when I didn't have my own set of rules yet.</p>
<p>I have a couple of people on hold .. knowing that I will meet them in the next couple of months..  , these are the kind of people I won't<br />
click "Don't know" on..  mostly because I do know them, by reputation by referral but not in person yet.</p>
<p>Once in a while there is this person  that you want to meet up with, get to know better, you are doing similar stuff and you planned to meet but just missed each other by 5 minutes.. difficult .. </p>
<p>LinkedIn is my personal addressbook , it helps me to keep track of people email addresses,  it helps me to see where people are moving to and what their new projects are.  </p>
<p>But please don't spam me there... it will only hurt yourselve</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I don't know on which planet I have been for the past couple of years , days  or hours  but since when do <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/virtualization/?p=256" rel="nofollow"><br />
VMware’s Vmotion, XenSource’s Xenmotion or Virtual Iron’s Virtual Iron support  Replication ?  </a></p>
<p>Live Migration yes, but Replication ,  No.  </p>
<p>I discussed this kind of technologies  with Mark and Vincent , Moshe and others already  a zillion times..  Continuously mirroring or realtime replication of a virtual machine is really difficult to do.  And I haven't heard from a working  scalable solution yet .. (Shared Memory issues such as we had with openMosix  still are amongst the issue to be tackled) </p>
<p>Live Replication would mean that you mirror the full state of your virtual machine realtime to another running virtual machine.  Every piece of disk/memory and screen you are using has to be replicated to the other side of the wire realtime.  Yes you can take snapshots of filesystems and checkpoints of virtual machines.  But continuous checkpointing over the network  , I'd love to see that.. (outside of a lab)</p>
<p>So with a promise  like that .. our good friends the CIO will be dreaming and the vendors will be blamed for not delivering what was promised to them.</p>
<p>But on the subject of using just Live Migration features as an alternative for a real High Availability solution  , I know different vendors are singing this song,  but it's a bad one.</p>
<p>Using Live migration in your infrastructure will give you the opportunity to move your applications away from a bad behaving machine when you notice it starts behaving badly, hence giving you a better overall uptime.  If however you don't notice the machine is failing, or if it just suddenly stops working, or if your application crashes you are out of luck.<br />
Live migration won't work anymore since you are to late,  you can't migrate a machine that's dead.  The only thing you can do is quickly redeploy your virtual machine on another node, which for me doesn't really qualify as a Clustered or HA solution.</p>
<p>Real HA looks at all the aspects of an application,  the state of the application, the state of the server it is running on and the state of the network it is connected to.  It has an alternative ready if any of these aspects fail.  Session data is replicated,  data storage is done redundantly and your network has multiple paths.    If your monitoring decides something went wrong another alternative should take over with no visible interruption for the end user.  You don't have to wait till your application is restarted on the other side of the network, you don't have to wait till your virtual machine is rebooted, your filesystems are rechecked and your database has recovered no it happens right away .</p>
<p>But Virtual Machine Replication as an alternative for HA ?  I'd call that wishfull thinking and vapourware today</p>

<p>Now if one could just make either an RSS feed of this or a create a calender out of it so we can integrated it in our favourite calendaring client.  Or just create a group on upcoming and keep that group consistently filled up.</p>
<p>They probably should already add Fosdem.org and Linuxtag.org 2007<br />
as the dates for those conferences are already announced.</p>
<p>They should also keep an eye on <a href="http://www.guckes.net/" rel="nofollow">Sven Guckes </a> page as he has some updates on events.<br />
and als on <a href="http://www.infodrom.org/Linux/calendar.html" rel="nofollow">Martin Schulzes page</a></p>
<p>Anyone else knows some locations where to find good conferences ?<br />
And yes the more specific conferences such as the ones on MySQL , Drupal or OpenOffice also deserve a place in that list !</p>

<p>But before you all start wondering   let's make this clear .. as far as we know Dries and I are not family .. so stop asking :)</p>
<p>Don't start bugging me about changes you want to be made in Drupal,<br />
Yes  you can try to bribe me by buying  stuff from my <a ref="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/registry.html/ref=w_h_em-si-html_viewall/026-9055627-6703621?id=I4Q3BS7AAO5L">Amazon Wishlist</a> , but you will be talking to the wrong Buytaert.   I`m just a humble Drupal newbie, using Drupal for my own blog and some small projects  just a hobby, won't be big and professional like... well actually like Drupal .<br />
You however won't be the first to buy stuff off my wishlist , given the fact that I`m <a href="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/">not new</a> to  open source and Linux in general.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Last weekend was <a href="http://www.t-dose.org/" rel="nofollow">T-Dose</a>  I was looking forward to see <a href="http://willy.boerland.com/myblog/" rel="nofollow">Bert's</a> drupal talk but I was way to late in Eindhoven , just in time to see his last 5 slides   Too bad I couldn't find him anymore after his talk. </p>
<p>Just after his talk I ran into <a href="http://mattinaction.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Matt</a> and <a href="http://tarrysingh.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Tarry</a> ,  Matt is always present at conferences , often giving good talks on stuff I care about such as <a href="http://openqrm.sf.net/" rel="nofollow">openQRM</a> this time.</p>
<p>It was great to finally meet Tarry in the physical world, and not just the virtual one, so the Irish Pub meetup in the late afternoon really should be repeated !</p>
<p>The Woman without a blog told me about her involvement in <a href="http://www.opendocsociety.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenDocsSociety</a> and the 2 upcoming launche parties.</p>
<p>I arrived way to late at the social event because of the Eindhoven Marathon parking issues we about to have if we didn't move Matt's car , but that way I ended up a a table with the guy from <a href="http://www.gravityzoo.com/" rel="nofollow"><br />
Gravity Zoo</a>, great stuff those guys are working on .. Looking forward to see some of their demos.</p>
<p>The Irish pub threw us out at 0200 , which was kinda Early.. but the result was that I made it only 5 minutes late for the <a href="http://zecke.blogspot.com/2007/10/openembedded-at-t-dose.html" rel="nofollow">Open Embedded talk.</a>  Now I really really want to start looking closer at OpenEmbedded as I feel it would be a really good solution for lots of the stuff different people  are doing wrong , but then I need to get some time slices from an altnerate Universe .. </p>
<p>As promised in Cambridge I went to <a href="http://dag.wieers.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">Dag's </a> talk on Dstat as I ran out of it in Cambridge coz of some urgent phonecalls.<br />
As I already have a private presentation about <a href="http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/mrepo/" rel="nofollow">mrepo</a> , I can now safely skip his next presentations :)</p>
<p>I had to run out earlier and drop off Matt at his car in the middle of nowhere before heading home.  But T-Dose is growing at good rate.  It's not yet big and overcrowded as Fosdem so at least you can talk with lots of people !</p>
