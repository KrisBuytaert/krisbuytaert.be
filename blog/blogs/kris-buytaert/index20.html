  <div class="content"><p>Sometimes you have to <a href="http://virtualization.com/guest-posts/2009/04/17/on-the-dangers-of-ovf/" rel="nofollow">step out of line</a> to get a message through just write a viewpoint down in totally black, ignoring the white parts.</p>
<p>Earlier examples of these tricks were my rants on <a href="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/node/713">raid</a> :) </p>
<p>The original work title of the <a href="http://www.virtualization.com/" rel="nofollow">Virtualization.com</a> post actually was "VMWare, the New Microsoft, they gave us point and click and no clue for the user" But I selfmoderated that down to a more gentle  title, not attacking a vendor :)</p>
<p>I think the message got through ...</p>
<p>Yes you get the,<a href="http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog/?p=757" rel="nofollow">"he must be joking"</a> feedback from some ,on one hand that accelerating  the effect and on the other some people might think what an idiot  ,  but that doesn't weigh up to the one person who realizes he should do integrity checks on OVF's too and other one that realizes he shouldn't randomly copy VM's back and forth while not checking where they come from ...</p>
<p>So  for clarity sake  I`m in favour of OVF as an open standard,  assuming it is wiseley used :) </p>
<p>On a side note ,  One of the people commenting  on <a href="http://twitter.com/beaker" rel="nofollow">Beaker</a>'s blog wondered if " he checks the signature of every piece of software he ever downloads"  ..  I let yum or apt-get do that for me..</p>
<p>It's not all black and white ,  Hope you enjoyed the show however :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Armijn asked me to spread the news about the upcoming NLUUG Voorjaarsconference that will as usually take place in EDE. </p>
<p><cite><br />
Every bit counts. From a single byte to billions of images, from one line of text to a gigantic tangled semantic web of documents, from clay tablets to 3D holographic memory, storage and the means to organize storage have always been important to humanity. Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes, it was said; a sailboat crossing the Atlantic still manages rates of a little over 1GB/s end-to-end.<br />
</cite></p>
<p><cite><br />
A petabyte of storage weighs about as much as a small car, but a large physics experiment can fill that up in less than a week. The modern rate of data production and amount of data storage --and crucially also data search and retrieval-- have pushed the limits of computer storage and the traditional file system further and further back.<br />
</cite></p>
<p><cite><br />
The NLUUG Spring Conference 2009 focuses on storage and the means to  organise it: file systems, physical storage, connections and search. The keynote speaker at the conference will be Ted Ts'o, author of the ext4 file system in Linux and CTO of the Linux Foundation. Other subjects at the conference are DRBD, desktop search and ZFS.<br />
The conference is in conference center 'De Reehorst' in Ede, The Netherlands. Information about the full programme and  registration can be found at the  <a href="http://www.nluug.nl/events/vj09/index.html" rel="nofollow">conference website</a><br />

As always members of NLUUG and sister organisations as well as students get a hefty discount.<br />

  <div class="content"><p><a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/news/prarchive/2009/open-source-channel-alliance.html" rel="nofollow">RedHat</a>   announced the launch of the Open Source Channel Alliance,  and <a href="http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/2009/04/channelling-power-of-open-source.html" rel="nofollow">different folks</a> already commented on it ..  </p>
<p>Frankly I think the Open Source "Channel"  shouldn't exist .. </p>
<p>So let's take a step back and see what the "Channel" actually means.</p>
<p>It used to mean that a vendor didn't want to manage the logistics of shipping and delivering his product to the end user, you know .. like the big boxen used 3rd parties to provide the logistics, often that "enduser" being a local system integrator that wasn't allowed, and still isn't, to order his stuff from the actual vendor, either because he is ordering in too small quantities or any other reasons. Logistics became marketing support , offering training and sometimes  presales support.</p>
<p>So the small/local system integrator has to order from his upstream reseller which often had to order from his country distributor, who then would order the box from the actual vendor, but in lots of cases contact between the vendor and the actual user is never made.  With physical boxen to be shipped, often to locations where the actual  vendor can't really have a presence this partly makes sense,  however sometimes things get ridiculous,  situations where a customer can talk to the vendor directly but can't order from him because of these channel partners wanting to have a piece of the cake are no expection.  </p>
<p>When it comes down to last years' software there is no box to be shipped anymore .. yet still often 2-3 layers of boxmovers are in the channel between the vendor and the customer.  So now all they do is forward the license keys , via email. </p>
<p>So how does a support call go ?<br />
Yep.. sometimes it goes straight trough that same channel...  slowly ..  This was one of the reasons why back in 2000 I decided to drop  any form of proprietary unix or proprietary software running on unix.  (Back then :   Solaris, Allaire Coldfusion , and the range of iPlanet products ..)  I was fed up with their absolute lack of support .. never getting to speak with people that knew the product, mostly speaking with marketeers locally pushing the product .. having to call my reseller asking to put pressure on the country distributor who then might call the acutal vendor ..   No thanks, not for me anymore<br />
I wanted to talk to the people who actually created the product   so Open Source  was they only way forward.</p>
<p>So what happens when former VP's of proprietary vendors such as Citrix  end up at startups such as XenSource for their next gig ,  what do you think happens... they want to reuse that giant network they've build over the years and have that network resell their products. So they call all their friends again  and set up a channel, of higly incompetent resellers that have absolutely no clue what they are moving in side the box.</p>
<p>Selling a product from a product sheet, rather than helping a customer solving his problem is the typical IT Sales guy job.<br />
He knows his spec sheets and when he doesn't know the answer he calls up on his upstream channel for more imput.<br />
They organized roadshows and demo's for customers and try to push them the newest and latest release of a product.  They are still thinking in terms of margins and uplift on a license rather than </p>
<p>Their "tech" staff is certified to know everything the vendor explained in the training (and nothing more) and will quickly escalate a problem they haven't seen before upstream ..  (well .. not that quickly .. but you get my pain..)<br />
Obviously this is the kind of partners the RedHat's  and Open Core vendors of this world love, clueless system integrators that have to open tickets and upsell support to their customers as they can't solve the problems themselves.  </p>
<p>So even with <a href="http://www.opensourcechannelalliance.com/index.php/founding-members" rel="nofollow">other companies</a> joining the opensource channel alliance , this really isn't a good thing for the customers, </p>
<p>On the positive side ... more people will get offers including a limited set of Open Source, and obviously  Open Core ,  alternatives as the channel salesdroid will add these solutions to his portofolio. </p>
<p>But will these people get the real benefits of Open Source ? Will they get the more suitable Open Source project for their needs ?  Probaly not ... </p>
<p>I really don't see how any of this fits with an Open Source Philosophy  , it just doesn't,  it's still the Enterprise Software Vending model 1.0 </p>
<p>Now where's my next channel partner golfday  invitation ?</p>
<p>P.S.: I should state: "The postings on this site are my own and don't necessarily represent Inuits' positions, strategies, or opinions."</p>

I heard different comments from that crowd... some of them liked the event,  good networking, interresting topics , a broad overview, meeting new vendors active in the Cloud, others of them didn't .. it wasn't a real camp , just some vendors pitching,  they didn't hear any new stuff , or we didn't touch the real stuff.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>When you eventually will buy Sun ..</p>
<p>Oh nooos.. I started this post last week and now it al seems in vain :(</p>
<p>Steven has some clues on what could have <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/good_bye_solaris_the_fate_of_suns_top_5_technologies">happened</a>,  I think he is right on the spot on with his Solaris prediction ..</p>
<p>He wonders why IBM would spend even another dime on Solaris, actually even today I can't even see why Sun is spending any more money on developing Solaris. But even with no acquisition his prediction of the future of Open Solaris imvho is spot on:</p>
<blockquote><p>
OpenSolaris will likely live on as a purely community-based operating system. After failing to gain any real traction against Linux, I expect it to become like the BSD operating systems: useful in niches and with a strong, core group of developers, but never to become a major operating system power.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As for Sparc,  well I told it before.. and given the Siemens-  Fujitsu split, given that Fujitsu has the money (which is where I have no clue)  and given 2  Sparc companies with completing markets , both geographically as on hardware and software level..  merging Fujitsu and Sun would make sense ...</p>
<p>Looking around me .. I think Netbeans has already been Eclipsed ages ago .. I once used to work with NetBeans, but today I don't know a lot of people who still use it.</p>
<p>As for MySQL,  <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/011046.html">Jeremey</a> has some good insights..  the fact that different prominent MySQL folks  have left Sun will only push the MySQL development model towards more openness.<br />
And towards an even more Redder RedHat alike  model,  we already have the first CentOS alike rebuilds of MySQL , so a distribution model based on the same kernel with different feature sets or focus indeed might be the future.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/if_ibm_sun_breaks_down_what_happens_to_sun">Steven</a> has a nice follow up on what can happen with Sun now.  But the obvious problem  would have been be the culture clash , at least for the MySQL folks..  , I can hardly imagine <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/gameguy/entry/sex_at_ibm_and_sun">al that nice code being written with no Liquor </a>  :)</p>

<p>We had a good laugh at different people actually believing that we planned on rebranding to <a href="http://www.pinuits.be/" rel="nofollow">Pinuits</a>, but we'll stay <a href="http://www.inuits.be/">Inuits</a> , But maybe next year we'll rebrand to Linuits :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>So the cat is out of the bag,</p>
<p>As of today Inuits is rebranding to Pinuits,<br />
The press release is <a href="http://www.pinuits.be/" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<p>We've had good feedback on the new name so far.  Different people told me the name matched better to what we are doing .  Actually my wife thinks our new name is much better as at least the Pin in Pinuits refers to our favourite Tux again ..</p>
<p>Finding an appropriate name for an Open Source consultancy company, with focus on Linux, Open Source Monitoring, MySQL, Open Source Virtualization , Large Scale Deployments , High Availability and  Drupal, isn't easy .. you want to show both community involvement and professionality.  And find a domain that's still available.</p>
