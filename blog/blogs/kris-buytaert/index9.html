  <div class="content"><p>One of the open sessions last week (corr: last month) at Devopsdays 2010 Hamburg was the one on packaging software.   It's always a big question on wether you package the software that runs in your infrastructure or not.     And if you package it .. what do you package ..</p>
<p>The general consensus of the open space was pretty much that you always package the software you deploy, unless you have some very good reasons not to.  Pretty much the way I've been doing for ages ..</p>
<p>Good reasons that were mentionned were the use of scripting languages that update extremely frequently, but certainly not for compiled code,  compiling code on a production machine also is a big nono.</p>
<p>There also was a consensus that you DO NOT PUT CONFIGURATION inside a package.  You can put in default templates, but you don't put in config files that should change frequently ..  There's plenty of configuration mgmt systems out there do that kind of stuff for you.</p>
<p>The naysayers claimed that packaging brings way to much overhead ... and others claim it takes to much time... however I feel it<br />
should just be a 1 time effort that brings devs and ops closer to eachother and from there on it should automated<br />
New versions of software don't mean that the packaging effort needs to be done again..</p>
<p>Another topic that gathered lots of questions was if you should be capable of installing multiple versions of the same package  , lots of people mentionned they didn't like fiddling with symlinks however the best comment in that discussion was that there is already a system out there , the <cite>alternatives</cite> setup .. provide by most operating systems that allow you to do so in a pretty clean way. I must admit I should look into <cite>alternatives</cite> more in depth too ..</p>
<p>The ever recurring question is wether one should package war files ?  Sure  as you then can also use the dependency models a package mgmt system brings to deploy the dependent libraries.</p>
<p>However when people ship products, rather than a live service   they seem to package everything , mainly because the code in the product isn't changing as quickly as a live website, or internally used application.</p>
<p>The biggest problem however is the frustration people have with  GEM or CPAN  packages .. they add yet another layer of management to a system,  most lots of CPAN packages are already packaged.. but when it comes to GEM's disaster strikes.   There's a lot of work left for distributions to integrate GEM and CPAN style packages.</p>

<p>All worked nice however  upon bootstrapping our Xen host the bridges stopped working ..     running the network-custom-vlan-bridges script manually  solved everything and created the appropriate bridges.  But at boottime it didn't.. </p>
<p>I added some debug info to the script and figured it never got executed at boot time.</p>
<p>Turns out that when I removed the headers Xen actually does configure the bridges at boot time, Xen probably checks for a shebang at the beginning of the file.</p>
<p>Putting the header at the end of the file therefore solved the problem. ,</p>

  <div class="content"><p>So I bought myselve a new gadget,  a tablet.    I wanted  a couple of things, first of all I love the mythdroid app  as a remote control for my MythTV,  but as it runs on my phone and  kids don't have a phone it was pretty much a blocking issue when I wasn't at home.<br />
The second thing I wanted was a device for the kids to play small games on ...   and I also want to use it for the kids to watch some movies while we travel.  On top of that  it would be handy if I could use it to surf the web from my couch while not having to open up my laptop.</p>
<p>I was looking into buying an Achos 10.1 which was due to be released earlier this month  but I was fed up with waiting so I went googling for an alternative , and I found one .. it's an Apad, or an e-pad .. I still don't know ..  the box says epad<br />
ebay listed it as a 10.2" Android 2.1 Epad Apad 1GHZ Tablet PC UMPC Netbook   It's not an iPad, .. it's chinese and it costs 1/3 of an iPad  and it runs Android.  Yes that's right .. I had it delivered from the <a href="http://a-pads.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">UK</a> within 2 working days for just about 200 Euro including shipping.<br />
Ordered on thursday afternoon .. on my desk before 10AM on monday.</p>
<p>Opening the box was  a bit scary .. it had a weird e logo on the side wich some people recognised as a kind of browser logo that I`m unfamiliar with  and the acommpanying manual was only mentioning an platform I don't want to use ,  however booting up the device reassured me .. there was a nice penguin on the bootup screen and seconds later  an android logo appeared.</p>
<p>The Good:</p>
<p>The device is really easy to work with , kids can use it .. (that was the goal wasn't it ? )  It has a USB slot where you can plug in external storage<br />
and it has a SD slot for similar use .. it came with a 512Mb SD card which I replaced with an 8Gb one .  It has an ethernet connection an extention cable with a real RJ45 connection .  Lots of apps are available from it's market</p>
<p>The Bad:</p>
<p>It's not your default Google Market,  the device has no access to the Google App Market but uses SlideMarket,  not all apps are availble for download that way, however nothing blocks you from downloading .apk files and installing them on the device.   For now I just swapped the SD card from my phone to get all the apps I wanted in a quick way but  I should actually test plugging in my  Android Phone using the USB and install the applications from the backup  as the phone does have access to to the Google Market  (Update:  this actually works)</p>
<p>Not all apps are using the full screen estate, they've been written with 3-4 inch phone screens in mind and not with a 10" tablet in mind.    I've heard the same rants about using iPhone apps on the iPad.  The fontsize of the device is configurable but not all text adapts to the new font size  and it also looks like the wifi chipset isn't the best around..  I often have to reconnect to my wifi</p>
<p>The Ugly:</p>
<p>Battery life  is really not good enough .. it should last  3-4 hours but it didn't even last  2 hours when I first used it .. however  I was busy installing new apps and testing lots of stuff   so in</p>
<p>I haven't figured out how to configure gmail, gtail and other google services yet  I should probably debug what's going on one day to see if it's actually a connectivity issue or if big G just blocks access from the device.</p>
<p>Would I consider it a 1 on 1 replacement for an iPad ? Probably not ...   it's not as stylish as the fruit device but looking at the features I wanted compared to the price I paid for it , it's the perfect gadget ...</p>
<p>If I want to work  I`ll open my laptop,  when travelling I`ll be using my  EEE , but to play with the kids and lookup stuff from the couch while watching TV it's going to be a 10" tablet.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>So earlier today the nice folks over at twitter figured it was a good time to change all the authentication to oauth ...  they might have announced it all over the place .. but it never catched my attention</p>
<p>The onlything that did catch my attention was that after not having ued pidgin for about 2 weeks I didn't have access to twitter anymore.</p>
<p>I`m using the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/microblog-purple/" rel="nofollow">purple-microblog plugin</a>  and the default version of that plugin in Fedora 12 wasn't really up2date.   The plugin supports OAuth as of 3.0 which was released ages ago.</p>
<p>The version in fedora-updates-testing however was already recent enough ..</p>
<p>So enabling that repo and running<br />
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text">yum &nbsp;update &nbsp;purple-microblog</code></span><br />
quickly solved my proble ..  till I disabled twitter in my pidgin again as there was way to much talk about some weird fruit ...</p>

  <div class="content"><p>You might have noticed that this blog stopped accepting comments about a month ago.. well. stopped accepting is a big word.. I was still accepting comments, only they were never submitted to the database and after entering a comment to my blog people  ended up on a white page.</p>
<p>So upon returning from holliday I set out to debug the issue together with one of our Inuits Drupal geeks and quickly ran into the following error.<br />
<div class="geshifilter"><pre class="text geshifilter-text" style="font-family:monospace;"><ol><li style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal;"><div style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal">PHP Fatal error:  Call to a member function has_more_records() on a non-object in /somepath/modules/views/plugins/views_plugin_display.inc on line 1992, referer: http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/comment/reply/1014</div></li></ol></pre></div></p>
<p>So apparently my veasion of views  6.x-3.0-alpha3 didn't really like to play with Mollom,<br />
I downgraded views again to 6.x-2.11  and Mollom started showing its Captcha's etc  again .</p>
<p>So apart from wondering how I ended up installing that alpha3 version (I`m sure Drush didn't do that), all is back to normal. and you should be able to comment on this blog again</p>

<p>openSUSE users can now do a mariadb install from their default repositories.</p>
<p>With all the fuzz about Snoracle and MySQL's future last year to me it became clear that we would end up having different MySQL based distributions,  probably with different names, and that it would be up to the Linux distributions to provide the users with what they preferred,  working with those Linux distributions<br />
therefore would be very important for the MySQL distributions.</p>
<p>Sadly my Fedora box doesn't allow me to do a yum install mariadb yet ... but I`m  sure that's only a matter of time ..</p>

<p>Then add to that list that there's also people out there that think that running MySQL over NFS is providing them High Availability,    or that using DNS Round Robin will provide them a scalable setup,</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Couple of Fridays ago we had one of our @Inuits days again.  Rather than having some people give talks and presentations about what they have been doing for the  past couple of months this time we set out to  research, test, and build stuff.</p>
<p>We split up in 3 different groups,  one focusing on CI and testing freshly build stuff with cucumber,   a second one setup and tested <a href="http://www.codership.com/products/galera_replication" rel="nofollow">Galera</a></p>
<p>We setup a 3 node Galera cluster , not really as smooth as we'd like to ..</p>
<p>Our first bump was that the installation of the package on CentOS is hell, it needs manual interaction such as replacing  packages.  Deploying this from a repository is probably not going to be a straight forward option.</p>
<p>Galera only takes care of replicating data, just as with MySQL MM replication there still is a need for an external tool to define where to access the database, and implement monitoring in such a way that you are connecting to an up to date database.</p>
<p><a href="http://poke152.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Karl</a> started wondering about Galera's locking,  turns out the locks aren't cluster wide, locks within the same node work fine.. so if galera is solely used for HA with 1 active node and X failover nodes, it will work (so all transactions happening on 1 node).</p>
<p>We also ran into some issues when trying to start a node which couldn't contact the wsrep_cluster_address point (which is a node it will sync from at startup if specified in the wsrep.cnf file) , it just didn't want to start. This means that when the referenced node (configured in wsrep_cluster_address)is down, you will need to comment it out before you are able to start the mysql server.</p>
<p>The fact that Galera replicates everythying brought us to the discussion if we really wanted that , or if we wanted more finegrained control over which databases or even tables we want to replicate and which ones we didn't want to replicate.  A minority of people wanted to replicate everything,  the majority of our group wanted finere grained control over what is being replicated to another node.</p>
<p>I`m sure <a href="http://www.lefred.be/" rel="nofollow">Lefred</a> will shortly be writing about the progress his group made on <a href="http://www.banquise.be/" rel="nofollow">Banquise</a></p>
<p>The day ended as it should .. with BBQ and plenty of drinks</p>

It wasn't really the moment to do the upgrade. </p>
<p>So when tonight I wanted to perform the upgrade I couldn't really find out how to initiate it again .</p>
<p>Apparently the trick is to put the date of your phone one month forward and you get the update request again.</p>
<p>So my phone has been updated ... so let's hope this indeed was the preparation for a real upgrade .. </p>
<p>Oh and don't forget to put it back to the original date :)</p>
