  <div class="content"><p>By now everybody and their neigbour has realized that indeed Everything is a funky dns problem,  Frank is giving talks about it at ZooCamp, and <a href="#">Serge</a> figured out the hard way the downtime of planet.geekdinner.be was due to a dns problem :)</p>
<p>But I told you different things before ... and some of you listened others are still reinventing the wheel as we go ...</p>
<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10249201-16.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=TheOpenRoad" rel="nofollow">Matt A.</a>  points out that the OpenBravo folks <a href="http://paolojuvara.blogspot.com/2009/05/extend-dont-customize.html" rel="nofollow">realized</a> that one should try to build on top of Open Source projects rather than modify core code ..</p>
<p>Wonder where he <a href="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/open-source-does-not-mean-customization-heaven">read that before</a> :<cite><br />
Some projects are prepared for local contributions, they have a modular framework that allows you to build on top of the project while not having to touch the core of a project, Drupal and openQRM are great examples of those, but not all projects are that smart. Needless to say that when you have such a modular framework you really shouldn't be modifying the core part of the platform, unless you are fixing a real bug.<br />
</cite></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2009/05/21/open-development-vs-making-a-big-splash/" rel="nofollow">Over at the MySQLPerformance blog, Peter </a> points out that  Open source projects <a href="http://virtualization.com/guest-posts/2009/03/17/floss-virtualization-doesnt-care-about-marketing-../" rel="nofollow">don't do</a> big fat marketing campaigns and the community doesn't appreciate features being developed in a corner then being released with a big bang ...  we prefer our releases Early and Often...</p>
<p>On Automating Software installations, a  <a href="http://everythingsysadmin.com/2009/05/gorillas-in-the-mist-or-sysadm.html" rel="nofollow">Tom Limoncelli</a> about how we install software and debug setups,  with a nice quote  <cite>"Oh my god.  Is that why nobody uses the GUI we spend millions to develop?"</cite>.<br />
Well <a href="http://madstop.com/" rel="nofollow">Luke</a> said it before .<cite>. If my computer can't install it .. the installer is broken <cite></cite></cite></p>
<p><a href="http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/2009/05/partner-programs-and-open-source-software-businesses.html" rel="nofollow">Stephen Walli</a> has some good toughts on how Open Source vendors should setup their partner programs,  indeed with their eyes wide open ..</p>
<p>I ranted on Open Source Vendors thinking they should still work with partners models and the channel the traditional way <a href="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/open-source-channel">before</a></p>
<p>However I have to admit that over the last month I did talk to people that do understand <a href="http://www.inuits.be/">our</a> Love / Hate relation ship with the Open Source Vendors that want to partner with us ..  and that some of the newer Open Source Vendors are actually attracted by our different way of tackling partnerships.</p>
<p>Oh well.. as <a href="http://blogs.opennms.org/" rel="nofollow">Tarus</a> says .. my 3 readers understand..</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Last saturday was ZooCamp ,  also known as Barcamp Antwerp II</p>
<p>The location , the Antwerp Zoo, was the same as for the last CloudCamp Antwerp edition,  so I was already pretty familiar with the  location.</p>
<p>Lots of new people at ZooCamp and also a bunch of regulars..</p>
<p>My 4th barcamp  and the 2nd where I didn't do a presentation,  I hope the fact that <a href="http://www.inuits.be/">Inuits</a> was sponsoring  ZooCamp  made up for that..   contributions can be done in different forms, and you can't always keep coming up with new topics.</p>
<p>I went to ZooCamp with a backpack full of internet connected things as that was the topic , my freshly upgraded TuxDroid  and my Chumby ..  but I didn't even have the time to fully unpack them and set em up.  The biggest problem with the chumby was the website authentication that was required for wifi access.. and a Chumby with no wifi is like a pub with no beer.<br />
I had even planned to do a rerun of my CloudSec talk from the last CloudCamp Antwerp, however the schedule filled quite fast with different interesting talks ...</p>
<p><a href="http://frank.be/articles/2009/05/25/presentatie-zoocamp-over-dns-problemen/" rel="nofollow">Frank</a> even  managed to hijack my favourite topic, yes that's right .. he did a talk titled "Everything is a Frakkin DNS Problem".    He pretty much covered zero of my typical cases so I can still do a run of my version of that talk one day  :)</p>
<p>This barcamp was almost back to basics, apart from the  location, wifi and the obligatory catering the crowd took charge , Lunch was everybody on their own .. so we ran out for Sushi , great ..<br />
Not sure if we need to cough up that amount of money for a location in the future ..<br />
Ideally we'd be able to find a location for free at some companies office, but that seems to be a difficult task for a saturday event.</p>
<p>Oh and we got to see the baby Elephant.. it was sleeping :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I`m not a big user of docs.google.com , but occasionally I use it sharing a public document to work on with friends  or collegues.</p>
<p>So we have this spreadsheet we're sharing with some family and friends to swap Disney stickers.    Google Docs has the option to publish that document publicly as html for others to view.</p>
<p>So I tried , and it generated me a very nice url</p>
<p><a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rtlvf2-JSU1Pw-oPtuIZBPg&amp;output=html&amp;gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;range=A1:C300" title="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rtlvf2-JSU1Pw-oPtuIZBPg&amp;output=html&amp;gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;range=A1:C300" rel="nofollow">http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rtlvf2-JSU1Pw-oPtuIZBPg&amp;output=ht...</a></p>
<p>My sleepy eye catched the A1:C300  ending part .. which was generated by the friendly popup that asked me if I wanted to show all Sheets, or just a range of the page.</p>
<p>Dare I pasting that URL into another browser and change the range ?  Like changing the range from A1:C300 to A1:D300 ?</p>
<p>Suprise suprise .. that worked ! I could perfectly see the content of the other cells. </p>
<p>Apart from pointing to the Google API the popup doesn't really mention that publishing only a range won't restrict the actual viewing off the other data.</p>
<p>I can imagine some less technical savvy people to expect the rest of their data is secure...   Well, it obviously it's not !<br />
Not sure if Google does this on purppose, or by accident.</p>
<p>If it stops working next week it was by accident :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Today I lost a machine,  a physical one, I couldn't find it back in my rack anymore.   One moment I was logged on to it, and when I instructed it to boot off the network again for a fresh installation I couldn't find it back anymore, it was gone.</p>
<p>When you have different ad hoc build development environments, you often grab whatever hardware is available to add to your pool and hope it doesn't kick you back, time always works against you when you have to build a fresh platform from a pool of hardware ready to be reused.</p>
<p>I had half a rack of hardware ready to be redeployed,  the default boot order of most machines is   Disk, Network  so we trigger a fresh network install by overwriting the MBR.   So the one machine .. after doing a quick check  to see if there was nothing relevant on it anymore we sent it to the reboot pool.</p>
<p>The host  was supposed to boot of the network, but I didn't even see a dhcp request coming in.  So off to the lab it was .. where was that machine..  none of the consoles I tried was the correct one... until I found one box.. with a really really old installation , a machine that had returned from a different office.</p>
<p>And then it all came clear ... unlike all the other machines this machine had a 2 disk raid setup, which we actually weren't using , we indeed hat cleared the bootsector of the first disk, but not the second disk .. and we never had really cleared the 2nd disk.  So rather than booting of the network because the first disk failed it booted of the old copy on the second disk.</p>
<p>Scratching that 2nd disk solved the problem ..   for once it wasn't a DNS problem, but the RAID setup wasn't really helpfull either :)</p>
<p>PS.  Yes re-labeling the machines is still on the todolist .. maybe next year :)</p>

<p>Last.fm is awesome .. it learned about my music habits,  and it got really good at streaming me My Music,  yes.. you read that correctly .. about 85% of the music it sends to my rhythmbox also lives in /home/MyMusic , that's like the CD's I bought and ripped to play anywhere I go.. I already paid for those, so why would I want to pay for them again  ?</p>
<p>Pandora did a better job in teaching me about new music I'd like  .. it gave me new music to listen to,   but it got killed in Europe, heck even my I can only be bought in the US Chumby doesn't want to play from Pandora.</p>
<p>StuBru tells me about the new music etc  , but it doesn't have a "Ban"/"Hate It" button so I only use it in my disconnected car, Oh it's not that  Last.fm was perfect  on the Hate part either.. I hate Filip kowlier's music , I told it a zillion times .. it keeps forgetting.</p>
<p>So when Last.fm eventually will close  down for people  istening from Belgium </p>

  <div class="content"><p>There seem to be different repeating topics within the Open Source and Geek community.</p>
<p><a href="http://delvauxkoen.blogspot.com/2009/04/how-belgian-firewall-would-block-naked.html" rel="nofollow">Koen</a>  did a good job explaining how the Great Belgian Firewall reall can't be solved using DNS tricks.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://datacharmer.blogspot.com/2009/04/mysql-community-and-sushi.html" rel="nofollow">Giuseppe</a> tackles the ever recurring Sushi.  It has to be said ... Geeks love Sushi  and not just the MySQl geeks ,   every conference we go to  we try to squeeze in at least 1 Sushi visit.. sometimes more .....   Nurenberg,  Manchester, Cambridge, Ottawa , ... and there's more to come .. :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>A couple of weeks ago I wrote a post titled <a href="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/dear-ibm">Dear IBM</a> ,  I was too late ..   I was on holliday last week when people started sending me text messages ,   such as .. "Game Over MySQL , Long live Ingress" or "No Eclipse for IBM",  etc ...</p>
<p>I had ideas  regarding the future of certain  Sun products at IBM,  now the game has changed .. it'ss how they will live on at Oracle :)</p>
<p>Similar Questions arise .. like indeed the future of MySQL,  the future of Solaris etc ...</p>
<p>So regarding the future of MySQL ,  I don't worry at all, on the contrary ..<br />
Oracle tried buying mysql before they already have Innodb .. they didn't kill it ..  the MySQL offering is complementary to the Oracle offering,  now they can tackle both markets.<br />
And as already mentionned  when writing my IBM letter ..</p>
<p><cite><br />
As for MySQL, Jeremey has some good insights.. the fact that different prominent MySQL folks have left Sun will only push the MySQL development model towards more openness.<br />
And towards an even more Redder RedHat alike model, we already have the first CentOS alike rebuilds of MySQL , so a distribution model based on the same kernel with different feature sets or focus indeed might be the future.</cite></p>
<p>Further there's what <a href="http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2009/04/to-be-free-or-not-to-be-free.html" rel="nofollow">Monty Said ... </a> hang on ... nobody mentions the fact that some core PostgreSQL people are on Sun's payroll  how's that going to turn out ?</p>
<p>A more interresting discussion is the future of Solaris one..  Oracle has always had an eye for Solaris.. one day it is their most important platform, the other day they tell the world Linux is their prime development platform,  it often was a matter of who was quoted.</p>
<p>As for Unbreakable Oracle did a smart thing.. they learned that they should build a full operating system themselves but ,  so why should they want to do that with Solaris ?</p>
<p>LinuxWorld has an <a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2009/042009-opensolaris-linux-could-merge-under.html?page=1" rel="nofollow">article</a> where oracle states their idea about Linux :<br />
<cite>"<br />
What we are working to do in the data center ... is to make Linux the default for the data center OS," Screven said in a speech at the Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit in San Francisco. "We want there to be no question"</cite></p>
<p>They suggest a merger between Solaris and Linux is a potential alternative ..  so what do we need to merge .. you'd say ZFS and DTrace ..,but do we really need ZFS ?<br />
There  has been a lot of writing already about BTRFS being the next big filesystem,  maybe it could make ZFS obsolete, maybe it couldn't ..</p>
<p>I got no clue on what's going to happen with OO.org .. so I`m really going to keep an eye on that one ..</p>
<p>In my opinion the real loser in this deal .. HP .. they don't have a full stack to play with ..  They have the hardware, some management and monitoring software soon to be obsolete  but no Operating System, no Database, no Appserver, no Apps.  So what's their next move going to be ?</p>
<p>Oh and if you really want to talk figures <a href="http://lmaugustin.typepad.com/lma/2009/04/oracle-buys-java-and-mysql-for-free.html" rel="nofollow">Larry Augustin</a> has a good take on it ...  the idea that Oracle could sell off some parts to Hitachi EMC etc, get MySQL and Sun for Free ...  then quietly wait for RedHat .. to get Jboss  who knows :)</p>
<p>PS.  I already blogged about the impact of the acquistion on the Virtualization area over at <a href="http://virtualization.com/acquisitions-acquisition-takeover/2009/04/30/oracle-gets-sun-xvm-solaris-zones-and-virtualbox/" rel="nofollow">Virtualization.com</a></p>
