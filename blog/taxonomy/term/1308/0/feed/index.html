 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/enterprise-open-source-adoption-bt-london</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Repost from our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inuits.be/news/enterprise-open-source-adoption-conference-bt-london&quot;&gt;corporate blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last monday some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inuits.be&quot;&gt;Inuits&lt;/a&gt; quickly crossed the channel for a day of speeches and talks regarding Open Source and its Adoption, the event organised at BT brought together a mixture of techies, legal persons and management to listen to and discuss about the current state of Enterprise Open Source adoption&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short introduction was done by JP of Confused In Calcutta , who mainly introduced Mark &quot;I`m from outer space&quot; Shuttleworth. Mark keynoted about Ubuntu .. he talked about Aubergine being the new Brown ... ranted (as everybody) about the Cloud , talked about a stronger focus to services rather than product building , talked about the ecosystem of &quot;people close to you&quot; for supporting solutions .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Bouch, of the Synapse Project at BT discussed ao the decisions they had to make, the varialbes they took in to account when starting&lt;br /&gt;
to use Open Source , discussions such as the reputation of the project, the internal skill zet, the ease of importing and exporting data in and&lt;br /&gt;
out of the project, and the different license terms were covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Katz , legal guy , who&#039;s also working on the International Free and Open Source Software Law Review gave an overview of the legal impact of Opensource . We learned that his customers have similar questions as ours, such as when to publish the code, what code to publish, when to look for alternative licenses etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was avid discussion regarding the Affero GPL license and using Open Source as a key component to build your killar webinfrastructure while not contributing back etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the pannel discussion questions like Software Patents, and the fact that Ubuntu One won&#039;t be fully Open Source were tackled For us , most of the event was confirmation that what we are doing is the right thing to do, And that is worth a lot !&lt;/p&gt;
