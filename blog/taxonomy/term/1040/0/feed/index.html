 <title>Zenoss, the Book , the review</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/735</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/node/726&quot;&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; , Packt sent me their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.packtpub.com/zenoss-core-network-and-system-monitoring/book&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Zenos Core Network and Systems Monitoring&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://badgerfiles.com/blog/2008/09/24/zenoss-core-book-excerpts/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Michael Badger&lt;/a&gt; to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I spend the past couple of weeks trying to crawl my way trough it.   Not that there was any problem with the book, more with my schedule :)   I was hoping to finish it some time ago but time was working against me, even last week when my flight back from Zurich was a bit shorter than planned I couldn&#039;t finish reading the book.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yesterday I managed,  Michael managed to write a good book on a hot topic during what was probably one of the most busy of his life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 8 chapters Michael manages to explain the different aspects of Zenoss fairly well, he even touches the creation of ZenPacks and extending Zenoss in general also.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a fairly good read and showed me a couple of new insights into Zenoss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However although Zenoss is  heavily SNMP based there is little information on SNMP in general and MIB more in detail ?   People really new to systems monitoring might want to have a couple of more pages on these topics.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those not familiar to Zope the mentioning of TALES expressions might also raise some eyebrows, luckily there has been a full Appendix dedicated  to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time permitting I would have hoped he could of gone a bit more in detail on creating a ZenPack that did a bit more than checking the status of a page.  Looking into the status of an Apache or MySQL or other relevant daemon , or the Squid internal statistics  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you are new to Zenoss and you want to have a quick headstart into monitoring your infrastructure with it this book is a really really good start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scribd.com/doc/5371809/Zenoss-Core-Network-and-System-Monitoring-Sample-Chapter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;There&#039;s a free preview Chapter at Scribd.com&lt;/a&gt; and also at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.packtpub.com/article/user-management-in-zenoss&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Packt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
