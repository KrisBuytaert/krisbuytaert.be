 <title>10 or 100 Virtualization vendors to watch die fast in 2008?  </title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/519</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tarrysingh.blogspot.com/2007/12/10-or-100-virtualization-vendors-to.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tarry&lt;/a&gt; is pointing us to a couple of companies that he thinks we should watch  in the Virtualization area next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#039;s right.. these are exactly the kind of companies we will watch die fast in the next couple of years.   All proprietary vendors,  placing a bet on becoming the next datacenter integrator are are placing their money on the wrong side of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why on earth would a sane IT manager want to  bet his infrastructure on a 3rd party tool that implements on top of a proprietary vendor ?  Because he wants to be locked into an infrastructure where he looses control over what he wants to be running ?  Does he want an environment  where he will be forced to puzzle together functionality he really wants by trying to integrate different proprietary vendors that won&#039;t play along ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck haven&#039;t we learned enough over the last decades .. the key to growth is interoperability and openness.  That&#039;s how the web was build .. it wasn&#039;t build buy 100 proprietary software vendors setting up a different service you could talk to with different fat management client all trying to accomplish the same features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you still haven&#039;t understood that .. please move one ... but don&#039;t bother me.&lt;/p&gt;
