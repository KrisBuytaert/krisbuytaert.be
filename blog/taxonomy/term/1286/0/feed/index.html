 <title>On Conferences</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/conferences</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Somehow this year my schedule really isn&#039;t going to get filled with conferences,unlike my 13 speaking engagements last year this year I decided to go for a lot less :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Froscon together with OpenSQLCamp is convienently scheduled during an already long planned family weekend ..  but I really hope to go there nex year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been wanting to go south for conferences for ages, Spain, France, Portugal, Italy , Greece are all places I&#039;d love to go and see how the different Open Sourcen conferences play out there.  This summer there actually were some  different conferences tha took place in Spain, Gran Canaria etc .  but I coouldn&#039;t make it there  for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.babietje.be/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;obvious reasons..&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The October conference schedule has another but similar problem , apart from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.t-dose.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;T-Dose&lt;/a&gt; which I plan on going to again, I`m doomed to miss &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linux-kongress.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LinuxKongress 2009 &lt;/a&gt;  and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netways.de/en/osmc/y2009/uebersicht/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Open Source monitoring&lt;/a&gt; conference as they both collide with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devopsdays.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DevOpsDays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinuxKongress  was initially scheduled for late september which meant it was on my planning but as they rescheduled  because of a conflict with the Linux Plumbers Conference at the other side of the ocean , it means that for the 2nd year in row I`ll miss LinuxKongress (last year was on purpose as I had already been to OLS)  ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I`m on the lookout for some new and exiting conferences to go to :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an OpenSourceWorldConference in Malaga last couple of years , but their site hasn&#039;t been updated anymore for 2009 .. anyone knows what&#039;s going on there ?&lt;/p&gt;
