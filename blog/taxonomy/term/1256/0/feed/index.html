 <title>ZooCamp</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/zoocamp-0</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last saturday was ZooCamp ,  also known as Barcamp Antwerp II&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The location , the Antwerp Zoo, was the same as for the last CloudCamp Antwerp edition,  so I was already pretty familiar with the  location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of new people at ZooCamp and also a bunch of regulars..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 4th barcamp  and the 2nd where I didn&#039;t do a presentation,  I hope the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inuits.be&quot;&gt;Inuits&lt;/a&gt; was sponsoring  ZooCamp  made up for that..   contributions can be done in different forms, and you can&#039;t always keep coming up with new topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to ZooCamp with a backpack full of internet connected things as that was the topic , my freshly upgraded TuxDroid  and my Chumby ..  but I didn&#039;t even have the time to fully unpack them and set em up.  The biggest problem with the chumby was the website authentication that was required for wifi access.. and a Chumby with no wifi is like a pub with no beer.&lt;br /&gt;
I had even planned to do a rerun of my CloudSec talk from the last CloudCamp Antwerp, however the schedule filled quite fast with different interesting talks ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://frank.be/articles/2009/05/25/presentatie-zoocamp-over-dns-problemen/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Frank&lt;/a&gt; even  managed to hijack my favourite topic, yes that&#039;s right .. he did a talk titled &quot;Everything is a Frakkin DNS Problem&quot;.    He pretty much covered zero of my typical cases so I can still do a run of my version of that talk one day  :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This barcamp was almost back to basics, apart from the  location, wifi and the obligatory catering the crowd took charge , Lunch was everybody on their own .. so we ran out for Sushi , great ..&lt;br /&gt;
Not sure if we need to cough up that amount of money for a location in the future ..&lt;br /&gt;
Ideally we&#039;d be able to find a location for free at some companies office, but that seems to be a difficult task for a saturday event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and we got to see the baby Elephant.. it was sleeping :)&lt;/p&gt;
