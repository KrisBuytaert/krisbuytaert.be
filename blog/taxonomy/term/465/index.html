For those who don't know FOSDEM, (where have you been hiding for the past 13 years ? )  Fosdem is the annual Free and Open Source Developers European meeting. If you are into open source , you just can't mis this event where thousands of likeminded people will meet.</p>
<p>And if 2 days of FOSDEM madness isn't enough people organise events around it.</p>
<p>Last year I organised PuppetCamp in Gent, the days before Fosdem and a MonitoringLove Hackfest in our office the 2 days after FOSDEM This year another marathon is planned.</p>
<p>On Friday (31/1/2014) the CentOs community is hosting a <a href="http://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Brussels2014" rel="nofollow">Dojo in Brussels</a> at the IBM Forum. (Free, but registration required by the venue)</p>
<p>After the success of PuppetCamp in Gent last year we decided to open up the discussion and get more Infrastructure as Code people involved in a <a href="http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/" rel="nofollow">CfgMgmtCamp.eu</a>  </p>
<p>The keynotes for CfgMgmtCamp will include the leaders of the 3 most popular tools around ,  both Mark Burgess, Luke Kanies and Adam Jacob will present at the event which will take place in Gent  right after Fosdem.  We expect people from all the major communities including, but not limited to , Ansible, Salt, Chef, Puppet, CFengine, Rudder, Foreman and Juju (Free but registration required for catering)</p>
<p>And because 3 events in one week isn't enough the RedHat Community is hosting their <a href="http://community.redhat.com/blog/2013/12/announcing-infrastructure-next/" rel="nofollow">Infrastructure.next</a> conference after CfgMgmtCamp at the same venue.  (Free but registration required for catering)</p>
<p>cya in Belgium next year..</p>

  <div class="content"><p>When I read <a href="http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2009/02/time-to-move-on.html" rel="nofollow">Monty's </a> post on leaving this passage struck me the most.</p>
<p><cite>The main reason for leaving was that I am not satisfied with the way the MySQL server has been developed, as can be seen on my previous blog post. In particular I would have like to see the server development to be moved to a true open development environment that would encourage outside participation and without any need of differentiation on the source code. Sun has been considering opening up the server development, but the pace has been too slow.</cite></p>
<p>In short,  Sun isn't open enough.  I think <a href="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/search/node/sun">I've said that enough</a>,  it's typically more Open Core than Open Source .. and for a growing amount of people.. that isn't good enough.</p>
<p>Reacting on that post we see  Matt Asay <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10157183-16.html" rel="nofollow">trying to convince</a> his CNet Audience that Open Source Ideals don't translate well into a big sofware business.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://blogs.opennms.org/?p=595" rel="nofollow">Tarus</a> view <cite>I see it as just the opposite. Open source spells the end of big software, if big software is defined as companies that make billions of dollars from selling software licenses.</cite> is much more to the point.</p>
<p>And the way Sun has been working, with MySQL, Virtualbox and different others doesn't seem to work that well either.<br />
I stopped counting the <a href="http://mtocker.livejournal.com/48442.html" rel="nofollow">P companies</a>  but I think I`m allmost a point where I know mere ex-Sun/MySQL employees than current Sun/MySQL employees and it's not just on the MySQL side that this happens.</p>
<p>Maybe Monty leaving Sun will wake up the powers that be,  maybe it won't.  </p>
<p>Finishing off with another quote from Tarus<br />
<cite><br />
In my mind Monty is a role model and I wish him all the best.<br />

  <div class="content"><p><a href="http://blogs.mysql.com/kaj/2008/10/31/dopplr-joining-the-social-network-for-travellers/" rel="nofollow">Kaj</a> wrote about using <a href="http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/KrisBuytaert" rel="nofollow">Dopplr</a> to keep track of where colegues and friends are traveling and finding out about accidental meetups.   (I even use it to track where one of the Inuits collegues work plans)<br />
Now I have never met <a href="http://datacharmer.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Giuseppe</a> , but we shared slides before so I'd love to meet him one day .. connecting to him via Dopplr gives me that opportunity .. who knows one day Dopplr will tell me we have matching travel schedules. </p>
<p>Earlier this week <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/" rel="nofollow">LinkedIn</a> announced <a href="http://www.tripit.com/" rel="nofollow">Tripit</a> as one of their first integrated applications,  I was a bit dissapointed  I use Tripit to let Dopplr learn about my trips , but I really prefer Dopplr over Tripit.     </p>
<p>Now there are 2 things I would like to acoomplish with these kind of tools.<br />
First of all I don't mind giving all of my LinkedIn contacts, so my whole addresbook, access to my upcoming travel plans so I can meet up with them again if our plans happen to match.  On the other hand I use LinkedIn as my addressbook,  so it only contains people I've met, or collaborated with (sometimes even over a decade ago) . And  there are a bunch of people out there that I haven't met yet  but that I'd love to meet one day and buy some beers or even dinner/lunch.  I'd love to connect to them on Dopplr to make that happen but I don't want to have them connected on LinkedIn (yet). </p>
<p>So when Dopplr integrates with LinkedIn I hope they think about this kind of scenario ..</p>
<p>Oh and btw.. <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2008/10/30/i-unsubscribed-from-the-planet-mysql-feed/" rel="nofollow">Xaprb</a> rocks !</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Over the past couple of days Sun has been getting a lot of feedback on it's behaviour with open source.</p>
<p>So there is <a href="http://www.linux-foundation.org/weblogs/amanda/2008/02/17/hey-jonathan-the-l-in-lamp-is-literal/" rel="nofollow">Amanda McPherson</a> trying to teach Sun that the L in LAMP really stands for Linux.</p>
<p>And then there was <a href="http://mail.opensolaris.org/pipermail/ogb-discuss/2008-February/004488.html" rel="nofollow">Roy T. Fielding</a>  quiting the Open Solaris community.<br />
I'm still wondering why a company that once bought StarDivision because it was cheaper to buy the company than to pay licenses for similar functionality, keeps maintining their own kernel stack rather than contributing to one  that is way more popular and as a much larger userbase.<br />
Its not like they have a die hard community they will loose,  it's not like they will loose customers over it.  When Sun says that Linux is the new Solaris their customers will just follow.</p>
<p>Personally I stopped working with Solaris ages ago... when we ocasionally run into a customer that wants us to deploy things on Solaris we always have to spend extra time GNUifying the box, which is yet another pain.</p>
<p>Sun had to learn the hard way  from the JAVA crowd that they do care about Licensing and a community only starts to build when they like what they see.  and it's exactly that community that Solaris is still lacking.</p>
<p>Virtualbox  also is in the same boat,  they have a good user community, but they don't have a lot of contributers as they require contributors so use the MIT license and even sign some papers.</p>
<p>In a way MySQL used to be the same ,  altough lots changed during the last couple of years , but back a couple of years ago nobody outside of MySQL was contributing code,  there was a gigantic user community, but not really a developer community.</p>
<p>The big difference here is in community.. not customer base, these people are actually using MySQL because they are freely choosing so.  Not because their boss or corporate policy tells them to.<br />
But MySQL learned, and is changing,  it currently has also non employees contributing .. often ex employees  but also other people , people that form a real community.</p>
<p>Today  .. if you really want to cash out  ... create an product open source it ,create a user community around it but don't allow contributors,  my bet is Sun will buy you :)</p>
<p>I told it before.. I really really hope one day Sun will understand .. but from the past couple of acquisitions..  they seem to be taking the same path over and over again.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://mike.kruckenberg.com/archives/2007/08/mysql-takes-another-step-away-from-open-source.html">Mike Kruckenberg's article</a> on the topic someone comments and asks how this is different from the RedHat model,  I only see one difference,  today we don't have a CentOS yet for MySQL ..  I`m sure it's just a matter of time and someone will start building RPM/Debian packages from the source repository.  (If it's not already happening today)</p>
<p>As long as MySQL keeps all their source code free ..</p>
