 <title>Open Source Days 2008 , Copenhagen, Day 1</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/737</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m expecting different people not using Dopplr to come back to me next week and tell me they were in Denmark also , as Copenhagen is the place to be this week(end)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was late for the first talk on how to automate a large scale school environment with gentoo.  So I missed the rationale for the development of DIPO, and I didn&#039;t want to bother the speaker with questions he had already explained in his earlier slides, however .. it spelled &quot;reinventing the wheel&quot; all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second speaker apologised for being late on schedule as the first speaker had to compile everything.  Nigel Kersten from from Google talked about Puppet, need I say more.. it was great :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So lunch is really really early here as from 11u30 on , however I didn&#039;t mind as I was up since 5 , so I actually was pretty hungry :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch  3 talks and a Keynote were scheduled.  In order not to be late for my own talk I headed into the Open Solaris Storage talk ... ,  not really interesting :( &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny quote from the talk however &quot;The clients are still Linux, but the server is already solaris&quot;...funny thing to say ... certainly for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/idg/IDG_852573C400693880002574CE00371FE1.html?ref=technology&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dying breed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own talk was fairly well attended, people were sitting on the stairs in the Auditorium and there was a lot of Q&amp;amp;A after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said in my talk last week in Zurich  I don&#039;t think&lt;br /&gt;
Sun has a really clear message with what they are doing with xVM etc&lt;br /&gt;
So the talk aftermine should have cleared that out shouldn&#039;t it.&lt;br /&gt;
Well it didn&#039;t , all I got back from it was .. &quot;We ported Xen to Solaris&quot; , and &quot;Our demo doesn&#039;t work because of a funky dns problem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Robin Rowe is keynoting about about Linux at the Movies.. and tonight it&#039;s off to the Social event .. well one of them :)&lt;/p&gt;
