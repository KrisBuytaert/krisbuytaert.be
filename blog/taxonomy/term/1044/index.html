  <div class="content"><p>I'm expecting different people not using Dopplr to come back to me next week and tell me they were in Denmark also , as Copenhagen is the place to be this week(end)</p>
<p>I was late for the first talk on how to automate a large scale school environment with gentoo.  So I missed the rationale for the development of DIPO, and I didn't want to bother the speaker with questions he had already explained in his earlier slides, however .. it spelled "reinventing the wheel" all over again.</p>
<p>The second speaker apologised for being late on schedule as the first speaker had to compile everything.  Nigel Kersten from from Google talked about Puppet, need I say more.. it was great :)</p>
<p>So lunch is really really early here as from 11u30 on , however I didn't mind as I was up since 5 , so I actually was pretty hungry :)</p>
<p>After lunch  3 talks and a Keynote were scheduled.  In order not to be late for my own talk I headed into the Open Solaris Storage talk ... ,  not really interesting :( </p>
<p>Funny quote from the talk however "The clients are still Linux, but the server is already solaris"...funny thing to say ... certainly for a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/idg/IDG_852573C400693880002574CE00371FE1.html?ref=technology" rel="nofollow">dying breed.</a></p>
<p>My own talk was fairly well attended, people were sitting on the stairs in the Auditorium and there was a lot of Q&amp;A after.</p>
<p>As said in my talk last week in Zurich  I don't think<br />
Sun has a really clear message with what they are doing with xVM etc<br />
So the talk aftermine should have cleared that out shouldn't it.<br />
Well it didn't , all I got back from it was .. "We ported Xen to Solaris" , and "Our demo doesn't work because of a funky dns problem."</p>
<p>So Robin Rowe is keynoting about about Linux at the Movies.. and tonight it's off to the Social event .. well one of them :)</p>
