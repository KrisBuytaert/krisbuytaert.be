 <title>Testing the RoboMow 510</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/testing-robomow-510</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I noted fellow geek &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nettooor.be/&quot;&gt;Peter Vanwelkenhuysen&lt;/a&gt; was talking about his #robomowtest experiences.  obviously I wanted to know how he got to test one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some tweets and mails later I was making arrangements with Lennert van der Pols  from Friendly Robotics  too.&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;ve been thinking about buying a RoboMower for years . always have been delaying the purchase since we were planning to move&lt;br /&gt;
Since we moved, my wife has been a bit sceptic  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/pics/robomow/IMAG0120.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So last week Lennert came by and gave us almost an hour of explanation on ,  he guided us trough the basic functions of the Robomow,  gave us some advise on where to lay the cable.&lt;br /&gt;
And how to operate, the device.  He also explained us that we could make a hole in the fence and  have the Robomow ,  mow the front part too , rather than pick up the mower and move it manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#039;t be surprised we got an Albino one :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/pics/robomow/IMAG0121.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#039;t really have time to install the wire till later that evening.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinning down the back part of our lawn (we opted not to do both front and back during the test period) , took me about an hour.   Some of the pins broke during the installation &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/pics/robomow/IMAG0123.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a cherry tree with some big trunks and they could be troublesome ..  so we evaded that part. as it was near the back of the garden and&lt;br /&gt;
Also in the left back behind the swing there is more moss than grass so we opted to lay the cable before the left back pole of the swing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after the first attempt of pinning down the cable in the ground , it was time to power on the Robomower ,  I was greeted with a pretty straight forward menu to configure it.&lt;br /&gt;
I`m one of those persons who really doesn&#039;t like user interfaces in my natvive language , Dutch.  So I have pretty much all of my electronics in English...   the problem with the&lt;br /&gt;
Robomow and English is that it assumes you live in a country that doesn&#039;t understand the metric system.   So I had to convert the size of my garden to sft.&lt;br /&gt;
(I checked for options in the menu later, but Lennert confirmed there&#039;s no  option to put to the metric system )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a couple of times to align the basestation with the wire, but after the Robomow starts testing if it can crawl along your garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that the frustrating part of the installation starts here.    Around the trees we had some parts where the trunks were creating a little to steep trail, it took me about 4-5 runs before I eventually got&lt;br /&gt;
it right.  The Robomow really takes its time to get stuff right.  One of the problems we had was that one of the corners didn&#039;t really have that much grass, and each time the&lt;br /&gt;
mower passed it made the ground softer so after a couple of runs it actually got stuck I had to tighten in the corner. &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/pics/robomow/IMAG0133.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after installing the Robomow it was a good time to let it mow for the very first time, it ran for about an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in the middle of a Hangout with some collegues as I suddenly  noticed that the Robomow had stopped.&lt;br /&gt;
Apparently even while I had been very carefully putting the cable in I hadn&#039;t been carefull enough... The Robot had cut it&#039;s own wire and decided to call it a day.&lt;br /&gt;
(this was wednesday evening) .   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On thursday morning I tried quickly tried  fixing  the cable as described in the video below...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZfBXVYfRS7c&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However at my first attempt the blue isolater failed to actually lock the cables inside and I had to rush to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to saturday evening.. the first timeslot I had to actually fix the cable... with a bit more patience I actually managed to secure the cables again ,  and the robot started doing it&#039;s work again.&lt;br /&gt;
I reprogrammed it to leave it&#039;s base every day at 8 in the morning rather than the default 1300,  that way by the time the weather is good enough for the kids to play outside the lawn has been mown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday and tuesday morning it rained ... on tuesday I saw the robot come out for a short while.. then decide to do the smart thing and go back to it&#039;s base station.&lt;br /&gt;
Today however the weather was dry.. so the robot had time to go on a suicide mission again ... yes that&#039;s right .. it managed to cut its cable again ...  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/pics/robomow/IMAG0135.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBC... &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Will Poken  catch on ? </title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/will-poken-catch</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://doyoupoken.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Poken&lt;/a&gt; is the new gadget in town. &lt;a href=&quot;http://streamlinedmind.com/2008/12/03/poken-the-future-of-social-networking/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; people called it the future of social networking.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of exchanging data at the click of a button , or less has been here fore ages.  The problem always is that the tool needs to gain Critical Mass before it becomes useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember transferring my VCard from my Palm Pilot or Handspring Visor to other people&#039;s Palm Pilot , or using different IrDA protocols to transfer my details between different phones,  that worked fine, for the happy few that had similar devices. These days we transfer details over SMS&#039; messages or Bluetooth,  but then they are stuck in the mobile phone,  with the Palm I at least imported them in my PIM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is not everybody had a Palm, not everybody had a IrDa enabled phone , and people tend to turn off Bluetooth for security reasons.     The idea of adding a (soon to be rebranded) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tikitag.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TikiTag&lt;/a&gt; to your business card seemed cool, So far I could hand out 2 cards to people whom I was absolutely sure they had a reader ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So different efforts have tried already the same .. to exchange digital data while people had physical contact.   none of them seems to have catched on .. yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Poken is on the way .. maybe this time it will catch on .. who knows .. it surely looks more viral than the others ...&lt;/p&gt;
