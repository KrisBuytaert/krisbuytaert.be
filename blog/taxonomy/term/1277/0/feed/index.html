 <title>SquashFS errors during FC11 install</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/squashfs-errors-during-fc11-install</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;My FC10 to FC11 yum upgrade got stuck on a zillion dependencies .. well actually libssl and mysql from Remi .. but from there it&#039;s a whole chain of other things.  So I had the great idea to go for the F11 Live CD,   the LiveCD works like a charm,, only upon trying to install the live CD to my OS partition it started failing on me with a bunch of squashfs errors  ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=489698&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; F11Beta blocking issue  which apparently didn&#039;t get solved completely after all..  the annoying part is that I can&#039;t reproduce the issue anymore .. as my system is now fully working .. maybe on my office desktop next week :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well.. the full DVD ISO got downloaded and burned and now I can once again enjoy the annoyancies of a freshly installed distro, missing packages, configs that have lightly chaged etc :)   Wonder if sound is working out of the box now :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update:  It works .. partly ... (no sound in firefox it seems atm..)&lt;/p&gt;
