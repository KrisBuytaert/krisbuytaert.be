 <title>FAT</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/fat</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://laforge.gnumonks.org/weblog/2009/02/27/#20090227-microsoft_patent_lawsuit&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Harald&lt;/a&gt;  has a nice overview of the FUD that is being spread again by some company from RedMond ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now why are they targeting TomTom ?   Surely because Canon and Sony and different others are to big to sue,  Both my EOS400D, Ixus400 and K800i , are using a way to FAT filesystem to store files on,&lt;br /&gt;
I tried putting ext2 formatted disks in them but that failed :)&lt;br /&gt;
(Not running Linux or already  having paid up might be another reason)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harald notes that there is no difference between the Kernel.org FAT implementation and the TomTom implementation  so why aren&#039;t they going for a bigger fish ?     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I`m sure there are plenty of other companies shipping Linux based products that are allowing people to use their own Flashdisks hence using the FAT code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TomTom is originally from The Netherlands, yet the case is&lt;br /&gt;
filed somewhere in the US.  I wonder how the EC would react to such a suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well.. interresting times ahead ...&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Future of Zimbra</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/592</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The interweb thinks there isn&#039;t much future for Zimbra if Yahoo gets swallowed by Redmond.  I`m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different alternatives apart from the being extinguished during the takeover.&lt;br /&gt;
I have no clue how the core developers and the management of Zimbra was reimbursed when they were taken over by Yahoo, however I hope they didn&#039;t waste all their money and still have some money left.   As they went this far with the company already they must have some good contacts with financial people that can help them get a new company  off the ground    ArbmiZ or ɐɹqɯız would be good names ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They could either go with a fresh start, or Yahoo could be so smart to have the guys perform an MBO.&lt;br /&gt;
Or even sell the Zimbra assests again .. even at loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If getting the Zimbra organisation out of Yahoo  doesn&#039;t work why not hire the key developers away from the company effectively rendering it worthless ,  big chance you don&#039;t have to hire them away from their current job but just  be waiting at the front doors when the exodus starts,  people either don&#039;t want to work for the new company or will be forced to leave as they are redundant.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RedHat  has a big opportunity here .. they don&#039;t have a relevant mail offering yet, there have been rumors around RedHat going to partner with the OpenXchange folks but I haven&#039;t heard from that yet .., but other companies might have look at the codebase also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would we need a fork ?   We don&#039;t know yet .. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don&#039;t think we have to worry that much .. I think there are bigger things to worry about ..&lt;/p&gt;
