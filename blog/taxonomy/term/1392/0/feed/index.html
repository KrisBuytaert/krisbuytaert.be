 <title>UKUUG Spring Conference 2010</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/ukuug-spring-conference-2010</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I was in Manchester for the 2010 UKUUG Spring Conference, right .. make that 2 weeks ago , :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UKUUG usually hosts the more interesting conferences around ... , it&#039;s not just the schedule that attrackts me , yes there&#039;s the strong focus towards Larger Scale Unix (and mostly Linux) deployments and how to manage them, but there&#039;s also the opportunity to chat in real life with the Devops from across the chunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending time with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.devco.net/&quot;&gt;R.I.Pienaar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.build-doctor.com/2010/03/26/ukuug-spring-conference-2010/&quot;&gt;Julian Simpson&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/simonxwilkinson&quot;&gt;Simon Wilkinson&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/a/davz.net/alex-davies/&quot;&gt;Alex Davies&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;http://database-explorer.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Simon Riggs&lt;/a&gt; , Josette, and many others is always fun .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was in town early I went to the preconference beer meetup and met with a lot of people and chatted about config management, virtualization   and lots of other stuff ...  after the pub the plan was to go for curries nearby .. and while walking to the , ahem  Bus stop, I managed to recognise &lt;a href=&quot;http://monkeyiq.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Ben Martin&lt;/a&gt; from meeting him back ages ago in Hamburg for LinuxKongress , always fun ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from having to jump on a bus and our group being split at the curry place , rather than being able to tell the latecomers where to walk to and being seeted upstairs with the whole group , the curries were interesting and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I had been pushing &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.gardeviance.org/&quot;&gt;Simon Wardley&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter to submit a talk for the conference it was really great to finally see him present ..  His talk was the perfect soft introduction to the conference ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon&#039;s talk  was followed   by a talk on Security for the virtual datacenters,  after I questionned the speaker  if anyone actualy uses TPM outside an academic lab the talk suddenly changed into a commercial presentation for a Quack, nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ever energetic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shadowcat.co.uk/blog/matt-s-trout/&quot;&gt;Matt S Trout&lt;/a&gt; talked about 21st century perl before Simon &quot;Life is to short for SELinux&quot; Wilkinson talked about his experiences in getting the openAFS crowd  on Git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bummer Thierry Carrez didn&#039;t show us the real juice of UEC and just the installations of  a Cloud Controller and a Node Controller , but he managed to do so in approx 30 minutes as promised .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A talk titled Coherent and Integrated Configuration of Virtual Infrastructures always cathces my eye.. however when that talk turns out to be a Coherent and Integrated configuration only within the Univerity of Edinborough  (aka lcfg2) talk I`m dissapointed,  specially since it pretty  much didn&#039;t introduce any new concepts from the ones I introduced back in  my Durham UKUUG presentation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily Andrew Stribblehill gave a very interesting talk on MySQL scalability,  in which I promised him some answers to his questions for the next day :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conference dinner was without a doubt the best UKUUG dinner so far ,  no typical english &quot;food&quot;,  no weird location (Old Trafford, an abandoned warship) , but just a big chinese place and plenty of food !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started thurday morning in the wrong track,  I assumed to be in the Virtualization track, but I ended up in the Sun thinclient and Abusing Linux to serve weird desktops under the Green computing umbrella track, not my favourites ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Patrick and Julian started their Hudson hit my Puppet with a Cucumber talk (which featured some aweseom #devops content) I was a afraid that we&#039;d had to look for a replacment PostgreSQL talk as Simon hadn&#039;t arrived yet ..  Luckily he arrived in time for his presentation and he explained us about the new replication features that are slowly making it into PostgreSQL,   one way ... log shipping ...  not really up to par with other alternatives yet :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with no further ado .. here&#039;s the presentation I gave&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS.  If at a Ukuug event and not sure about a person&#039;s name ... try Simon.. pretty good chance you&#039;re correct :)&lt;/p&gt;
