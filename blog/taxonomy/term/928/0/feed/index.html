 <title>Tax Time </title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/675</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So it&#039;s Tax time here in Belgium ..&lt;br /&gt;
And this year the government forced me to replace my good old  identity card with an electronic one , hence creating a giant security gap.  There is a &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; key  involved.  One that I didn&#039;t create, one that has been created by someone I don&#039;t know, I don&#039;t even know who,  should I trust these people ?   Should I trust the fact that someone could have made backups of my keys ?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing private about the keys the government issued so I fail to see how they can identify me in a secure way..  There can be tons of people that have that key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways.. for those local that happen to still have an FC6 box around (like I do) with a cardreader, here&#039;s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/download/eid-belgium-2.6.0-1.rf.i386.rpm&quot;&gt;rpm&lt;/a&gt; for BEID, based on Dag&#039;s specfile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I`m off to loose yet another part of my privacy ..&lt;/p&gt;
