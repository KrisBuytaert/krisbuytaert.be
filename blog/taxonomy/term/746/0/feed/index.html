 <title>Migrate, MultiSite and Restyle</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/migrate-multisite-and-restyle</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Done&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of my lower traffic sites were still on an old Drupal 5,  others were at 6.4 and lots of modules were outdated.   So I set out to migrate all the sites to a multisite setup.   I now have a set of shared modules , shared themes and some specific ones .. just as it is meant to be.    And I only have 1 central Drupal instance to upgrade.  Next step is figuring out how to trigger the database upgrades from 1 central place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well 2 , ny personal stuff and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inuits.be&quot; /&gt;our corporate sites&lt;/a&gt;, that&#039;s the idea.   Personal site is on plain old Drupal 6.6 and for  the corporate one we are thinking to go with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acquia.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Acquia Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, but we&#039;re not sure yet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve added a new theme, however I can imagine most of you never saw the old one as most of you read this feed in an RSS readers, yet some people nagged me about my lack of style, and as over a decade ago I even won web design contests , something had to be done :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved some blocks left and right and the performance of the site has improved drastically now, mainly slow technorati loading widgets in the left column often blocked loading, that&#039;s all gone now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also , as some of the commenters on earlier posts complained the main &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; has no CSS as it isn&#039;t in the CMS.  So my next step is trying to find out a way that I can replace the now manually maintained files build from different includes into a more dynamical setup where I can also have feeds for my Publications and Presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I`m wondering if there is any microformat or so out there for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/presentations.html&quot;&gt;Presentations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/publications.html&quot;&gt;Publications&lt;/a&gt;  that I could use so other people could use that information in other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that there&#039;s just one site left  to migrate.. but that migration won&#039;t be for next month  as there is some custom modules involved that need to be ported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well.. off to some more content then :)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Managing your Resume</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/572</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a ref=&quot;http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/database/tarrysingh/archives/managing-your-resume-in-this-mass-parcipative-age-22042&quot;&gt;Tarry&lt;/a&gt;,  there are things missing on the current LinkedIn site that you really want in a resume.  The main thing that&#039;s missing is a skillset .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to abuse xmlresume to create my online resume and generate it in different open formats.  (Never even tought about making one in that weird format you mention and most of the clueless recruiters want you to use).  But nowadays my interest is heading&lt;br /&gt;
out too &lt;a href=&quot;http://microformats.org/wiki/hresume&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;hresume as a Microformat &lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;http://steve.ganz.name/blog/2007/01/linkedin-launches-hresume.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; LinkedIn now also supports hResume &lt;/a&gt; this really sounds like something the rest of the world might want to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However they need to document this more openly as I can&#039;t seem to actually see the hResume content using &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.codeeg.com/tails-firefox-extension-03/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
