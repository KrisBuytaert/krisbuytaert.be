 <title>Watching the Guards</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/watching-guards</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I noticed a weird drop in web usage stats on the site you are browsing now.  Kinda weird as the drop was right around Fosdem when usually there is a spike in traffic.  &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/images/PiwiwFail.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before you start.. no I don&#039;t preach on practice on my own blog,   it&#039;s a blog dammit,  so I do the occasional upgrades on the actual platform , with backups available, do some sanity tests and move on,  yes I break the theme pretty often but ya&#039;ll reading this trough RSS anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My backups showed me that drush had made a copy of the Piwik module somewhere early february, exactly when this drop started showing.   I verified the module , I verified my Piwik , - Oh Piwik you say .. yes Piwik, if you want a free alternative to Google Analytics , Piwik rocks ..  -   I even checked other sites using the same piwik setup and they were all still functional happily humming and being analyzed.... everything fine ...    but traffic stayed low ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/node/1052430&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; taught me I actually had to upgrade my Piwik too ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that brings me to the point I`m actually wanting to make...&lt;br /&gt;
as according to @patrickdebois  in his chapter on Monitoring &quot;Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?&quot; who&#039;s monitoring the monitoring tools, who&#039;s monitoring the analytics tools,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So not only should you monitor the availability of yor monitoring tools, you should also monitor if their api hasn&#039;t changed in some way or another.&lt;br /&gt;
Just like when you are monitoring an web app you shoulnd&#039;t just see if you can connect to the appropriate http port, but you should be checking if you get sensible results back from it , no gibberish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then again ... there&#039;s no revenue in my blog or its statistics :)&lt;/p&gt;
