 <title>T-Dose 2007 is over</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/471</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.t-dose.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;T-Dose&lt;/a&gt;  I was looking forward to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://willy.boerland.com/myblog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bert&#039;s&lt;/a&gt; drupal talk but I was way to late in Eindhoven , just in time to see his last 5 slides   Too bad I couldn&#039;t find him anymore after his talk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after his talk I ran into &lt;a href=&quot;http://mattinaction.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://tarrysingh.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tarry&lt;/a&gt; ,  Matt is always present at conferences , often giving good talks on stuff I care about such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://openqrm.sf.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;openQRM&lt;/a&gt; this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was great to finally meet Tarry in the physical world, and not just the virtual one, so the Irish Pub meetup in the late afternoon really should be repeated !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Woman without a blog told me about her involvement in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opendocsociety.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OpenDocsSociety&lt;/a&gt; and the 2 upcoming launche parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived way to late at the social event because of the Eindhoven Marathon parking issues we about to have if we didn&#039;t move Matt&#039;s car , but that way I ended up a a table with the guy from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityzoo.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Gravity Zoo&lt;/a&gt;, great stuff those guys are working on .. Looking forward to see some of their demos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Irish pub threw us out at 0200 , which was kinda Early.. but the result was that I made it only 5 minutes late for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://zecke.blogspot.com/2007/10/openembedded-at-t-dose.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Open Embedded talk.&lt;/a&gt;  Now I really really want to start looking closer at OpenEmbedded as I feel it would be a really good solution for lots of the stuff different people  are doing wrong , but then I need to get some time slices from an altnerate Universe .. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As promised in Cambridge I went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://dag.wieers.com/blog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dag&#039;s &lt;/a&gt; talk on Dstat as I ran out of it in Cambridge coz of some urgent phonecalls.&lt;br /&gt;
As I already have a private presentation about &lt;a href=&quot;http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/mrepo/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mrepo&lt;/a&gt; , I can now safely skip his next presentations :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to run out earlier and drop off Matt at his car in the middle of nowhere before heading home.  But T-Dose is growing at good rate.  It&#039;s not yet big and overcrowded as Fosdem so at least you can talk with lots of people !&lt;/p&gt;
