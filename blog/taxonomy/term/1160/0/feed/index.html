 <title>Is anybody else confused about Chef ? </title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/anybody-else-confused-about-chef</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt; absolutely confuses me..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://madstop.com/2009/01/16/opscode-announces-chef-a-puppet-competitor/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Luke&lt;/a&gt;  is confused too ..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Iâ€™m clearly disappointed that someone who has been a high-profile user of Puppet but has never contributed much in the way of code (Ohloh claims 2 commits) would decide to start a whole new project rather than attempt to contribute to Puppet&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now , if you know me a bit you know that reinventing the wheel,  or creating identical projects with no clear reasons is something I dislike .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at Chef&#039;s FAQ there isn&#039;t really a clear reason listed why they wanted to create a new project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could understand if Chef were written in a total different language .. but hmm.. it&#039;s written in Ruby again ..    I can only think of one other area where there are 2 major competing tools written in the same language and that is OTRS and RT, still wondering how that can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the core values of an Open Source project is that you can contribute, adapt , and even fork.. why would you want to start over from scratch ?&lt;br /&gt;
So launching a competing open source project in that way therefore doesn&#039;t really seem like a smart thing to do,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe one  way to explain it is  the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lmaugustin.typepad.com/lma/2008/09/commercial-open-source-in-europe-verses-the-us.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;European vs American&lt;/a&gt; style of Open Source Adoption ...   ,   Luke has the more European approach (consultancy, build new features, support, train, evangelize, earn a good living) , where as OpsCode with Jesse Robins in charge might head for a more American style (Productize, Dual License , CashOut ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So can the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.opscode.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chefs&lt;/a&gt; please explain why they didn&#039;t contribute to Puppet, or as their FAQ , well it doesn&#039;t really Answer any of the Questions&lt;/p&gt;
