 <title>Vendor Lock vs Vendor Lock</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/496</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Henning Sprang seems to have a different view on the concept of a &lt;cite&gt;Vendor LockIn&lt;/cite&gt;  than I do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://lazyb0y.blogspot.com/2007/11/openqrm-vs-vendor-lock-in.html#links&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The daily laziness: OpenQRM vs. vendor lock in???&lt;/a&gt;  ,  he describes how openQRM &lt;cite&gt;Locks&lt;/cite&gt; into using .. openQRM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not really .. at least not in my opinion,  although openQRM still has a long way to go  and the proposals for a meaner and leaner Henning gives are certainly valid,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;openQRM however does not force you to do anything you don&#039;t like.   The source is available and free, you can modify its behaviour , you yourselve can spend time on in, learn and modify the platform no one .&lt;br /&gt;
(given the complexity I agree you won&#039;t dive into it in just 5 minutes but you nothing (b)locks you) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly in the virtualization field openQRM gives you the freedom to migrate your machines from one virtualization technology to another,   Today VMWare, tomorrow KVM, the week after Xen&lt;br /&gt;
or all 3 or them from one management console (can come handy after a merger)   all with the same interface.  None of the commercial products out there will even think about giving you a GUI to manage their competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that when you go out and buy VMWare  , you can only manage VMWare instances and you get a framework that will also force you to work in a way you can&#039;t change.   You have only one company to talk to, VMWare,   (maybe via its integrators but they can&#039;t fix issues , they don&#039;t have the source)  with openQRM you can hire other people besides Qlusters , you can change to another organisation to support you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try that with VMWare , I fear you are Locked In&lt;/p&gt;
