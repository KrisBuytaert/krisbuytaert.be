 <title>Drupal Multimedia ..  reviewed. </title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/drupal-multimedia-reviewed</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/node/726&quot;&gt;reviewing&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.packtpub.com/zenoss-core-network-and-system-monitoring/book&quot;&gt;Zenoss book&lt;/a&gt; , Packt asked me if I would be interested in reviewing one of their fresh Drupal books,  they first suggested a book on Theming but but I opted for the  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.packtpub.com/create-multimedia-website-with-drupal/book &quot;&gt;MultiMedia by &lt;a href=&quot;http://aaronwinborn.com/&quot;&gt;Aaron Winborn&lt;/a&gt; one as Theming really isn&#039;t my cup of tee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/images/drupalmultimedia.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to get the book finished , mostly because of other priorities that kept popping up and being ill for the first week of the year .. but I finally managed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Drupal Multimedia book , gives a good overview of both Images, Audio and Video and dares to think beyond current MultiMedia.  With a zillion possible modules to choose from when starting to build a Drupal site it is often difficult too find the best module for a task,  different modules have similar functionalities and features.  Aaron saves you the trouble of figuring out which modules are suited best for what task by discussing.  For each media type he discusses  which module fits best.  However , sometimes he opted to discuss a Drupal 5 module that wasn&#039;t ported yet to Drupal 6, so you might have to seek for alternatives depending on your Drupal version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one of my sites I used the Flickr module that now seems to be outdated,  the book pointed me to the Embedded Media Module , so the book was well worth the time spent with it  and I`ll have all of my Drupal Hacking friends  read it, as it will save them time figuring out which modules to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up , the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.packtpub.com/guide-for-learning-nagios-3/book&quot;&gt;Learning Nagios&lt;/a&gt; book , but guess I won&#039;t be starting to read it before Fosdem .. :)&lt;/p&gt;
