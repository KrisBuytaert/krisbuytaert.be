 <title>Innovation in Startups</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/725</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I`m absolutely astonished when I see some of the ideas / concepts people are trying to build a busness around , call it a cool startup and expect VC capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I`m even more suprised that a big part of the world and even the VC world is falling for these ideas, or thinks that the general public will pay for such a product or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#039;s have a look at some TechCrunch 50 startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/32396&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; blogs about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.otherinbox.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OtherInbox&lt;/a&gt;,  when looking at their site  my first reaction was: Hasn&#039;t google been doing that for ages ?&lt;br /&gt;
The  ivo.rentoren+spamfromblog@gmail.com or ivo.rentoren+cocacola@gmail.com or ivo.rentoren+chanel@gmail.com type of addresses ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On which you can base filters etc  ?  So what&#039;s new ?   From reading their website I fail to see where they are differentiating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 articles down the road  I learn from  &lt;a href=&quot;http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/09/open-trace-and-yammer-shine.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Brady&lt;/a&gt; that a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yammer.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Yammer&lt;/a&gt; which provides a hosted version of Twitter is also launching at TechCrunch...   Now the idea of an enterprise Twitter version isn&#039;t stupid, but with a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;http://laconi.ca/trac/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Laconi.ca&lt;/a&gt;  already available in open source it is something everybody with a functional brain can implement in his own company.   Question arises obviously if Twitter itselve shouldn&#039;t host this :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yammer seems to be a spinoff of a much more interresting tool that I&#039;m actually using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geni.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Geni&lt;/a&gt; now that was/is a groundbreaking and  interresting tool to use for which I haven&#039;t found an equally strong alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having had a couple of ideas before where I usually killed the potential project after thinking about the business model I wonder if I just should have pursued the projects even though I myselve would never become a customer at such a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We belgian people tend to be to critical for ourselves it seems,  we think a project can&#039;t succeed to fast, so maybe we should start more stupid ideas and see how the rest of the world react.  Afterall.. &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekandpoke.typepad.com/geekandpoke/2008/09/googles-latest.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Reinventing the wheel  seems to be a popular hobby of a lot of people these days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
