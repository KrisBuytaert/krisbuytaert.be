 <title>Why publish  on Lulu.com ?</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/521</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arjen-lentz.livejournal.com/98238.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Arjen&lt;/a&gt; wonders why the MySQl Cluster Study book is published on Lulu and not trough MySQL &#039;s traiditional publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altough I was involved in the creation process of the mentionned book, I have no idea why this decision was made but to me it makes perfect sense.   MySQL Cluster is a piece of software that is still going to change a lot in the next couple of months and years.&lt;br /&gt;
A book published in a traditional way needs a minimal sales volume in order to be worth publishing.  If there even is a slight chance that by the time the book gets published a significant amount of content of the book has already changed traditional publishers shouldn&#039;t publish the book. Now over at Lulu.com a book won&#039;t be print before a customer orders it.  So when the book is being sent to me.   I get the current version of the book..   If in 3 months the authors decide to rewrite a chapter or make some bugfixes.   The book can be updated much faster.&lt;br /&gt;
I can imagine that people buying the same title in april next year will already get bugfixes on the version that will arrive at my doorstep in a couple of days.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least that&#039;s why I would publish a technical book on Lulu.&lt;/p&gt;
