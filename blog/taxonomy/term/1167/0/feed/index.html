 <title>My Social Network “Friend” Policy (Updated again)</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/social</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years I have joined several social networking sites and continue to use a few of them regularly. These sites serve different purposes for me and I have started to come up with strategies of whom to connect with where. Here are the general guidelines that I have developed (subject to spontaneous change and arbitrary override).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; I only link with people that I  know in person  , worked with in real life or have worked with online intensively in different open source projects.  , have communicated with over different media. there are couple of exceptions in my connections from my early days when I didn&#039;t have my own set of rules yet. (Some of them have been unlinked now actually) 
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn is my personal Addressbook,  not a public Phone guide :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I only follow people who inform and/or entertain me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and I don&#039;t care about followers, so don&#039;t expect me to follow you back.&lt;br /&gt;
(I`m not using Identi.ca anymore .. given no relevant userbase)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On location based services (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripit.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tripit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dopplr.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dopplr&lt;/a&gt; ), I connect to people that I would genuinely like to meet up with when traveling and who I trust not to rob my house when I am away.  If we haven&#039;t met yet,  but you want to meet this is the place to connect !&lt;br /&gt;
(Forget about Dopplr.. only Tripit for now..) 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doyoupoken.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I did Poken&lt;/a&gt;, but obviously only with people I meet in person, and I`m still waiting for that first Poken with someone I don&#039;t know yet.  (I was close but ... :))  (Update: Poken is kinda obsolete, and my battery is s dead anyhow)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sadly I`m using  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; again , I only  connect to people I know, and I generally Ignore all group invites, and block all applications. I&#039;d actually prefer not using it at all.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I`m keeping an Eye on &lt;a href=&quot;plus.google.com&quot;&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt; .. but I`m not seeing much action
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&#039;m so not &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plaxo.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Plaxo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xing.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Xing&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ecademy.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ecademy&lt;/a&gt; anymore, I sometimes log on there, once every 6  months hoping nobody was stupid enough to send me a message there ..
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To me Wink, Spock, Naymz and some others I forgot are Dead
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I join new social networks often with no intention of actually using them, but just to make sure &lt;a href=&quot;http://tdc.blogsite.org/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt; doesn&#039;t sign up impersonating me
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, those are my rules and I’m stickin’ to ‘em… at least, for now and when I don’t forget them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Idea shamelessly copied from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.contenthere.net/2009/02/my-social-network-friend-policy.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Seth&lt;/a&gt; :))&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Will Poken  catch on ? </title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/will-poken-catch</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://doyoupoken.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Poken&lt;/a&gt; is the new gadget in town. &lt;a href=&quot;http://streamlinedmind.com/2008/12/03/poken-the-future-of-social-networking/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; people called it the future of social networking.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of exchanging data at the click of a button , or less has been here fore ages.  The problem always is that the tool needs to gain Critical Mass before it becomes useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember transferring my VCard from my Palm Pilot or Handspring Visor to other people&#039;s Palm Pilot , or using different IrDA protocols to transfer my details between different phones,  that worked fine, for the happy few that had similar devices. These days we transfer details over SMS&#039; messages or Bluetooth,  but then they are stuck in the mobile phone,  with the Palm I at least imported them in my PIM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is not everybody had a Palm, not everybody had a IrDa enabled phone , and people tend to turn off Bluetooth for security reasons.     The idea of adding a (soon to be rebranded) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tikitag.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TikiTag&lt;/a&gt; to your business card seemed cool, So far I could hand out 2 cards to people whom I was absolutely sure they had a reader ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So different efforts have tried already the same .. to exchange digital data while people had physical contact.   none of them seems to have catched on .. yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Poken is on the way .. maybe this time it will catch on .. who knows .. it surely looks more viral than the others ...&lt;/p&gt;
