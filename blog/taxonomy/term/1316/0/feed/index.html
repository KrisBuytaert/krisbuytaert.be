 <title>Nines , Damn Nines  and More Nines </title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/nines-damn-nines-and-more-nines</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Funny how different experiences lead to different evaluations of tools. The MySQL HA solutions &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2009/10/16/finding-your-mysql-high-availability-solution-%E2%80%93-the-questions/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the MySQL Performanceblog&lt;/a&gt; list, are almost listed in the complete opposited order of what  my impressions are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok agreed, I should probably not put my MySQL NDB experiences from 2-3 years ago with multiple Query of deaths and more problems than you into account  anymore ,  but back then went in the list Less stable than a single node.   I&#039;ve had NDB POC setups going down for much more than 05:16 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
Ndb comes with a lot of restrictions, there are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for MySQL on DRBD, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/mysql-and-drbd-often-say-no&quot;&gt;I&#039;ve said this before&lt;/a&gt; , I love DRBD, but having to wait for a long InnoDB recovery after a failover  just kills your uptime ,&lt;br /&gt;
I remember being called by a customer during &lt;a href=&quot;http://lefred.be/&quot;&gt;Fred&lt;/a&gt; last holiday who was waiting over 20 minutes for recovery , twice, so putting the DRBD/San setup second would not be my preference.   But agreed .. it&#039;s only listed at 99.9% meaning almost 9 hours of downtime per year are allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand we&#039;ve seen database uptime of MySQL MultiMaster setups with Heartbeat reaching better figures than 99.99%  Heck I&#039;ve seen single nodes  achieve better  than 99.99% :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what does this teach us ... there is no golden rule for HA,  lots of situations are different,  it&#039;s the preferences of the customer, the size of the database,   the kind of application , and much&lt;br /&gt;
more ..  you always need to think and evaluate the environment ...&lt;/p&gt;
