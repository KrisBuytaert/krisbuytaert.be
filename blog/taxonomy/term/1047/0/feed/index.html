 <title>Open Source Days 2008 , Day 2 </title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/739</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was already up since yesterday 0500 , it was dinner with Sven , Robin and some other conference visitors at a Turkish Buffet place , after which we headed to what seemed to be a great bar where they failed to serve us while waiting for over 10 minutes, so we moved on to another place. and then to be &quot;early&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After walking around a bit in Copenhagen and looking for a bus stop to go to the university I managed to bump into Wim &amp;amp; Co who offered me a ride to the IT University. Where I was almost in time for the first talk by&lt;br /&gt;
Jan Wieck about Slony-I,  A master to multiple slaves-replication system for PostgreSQL&lt;br /&gt;
Given my recent MySQL MultiMaster setups I was fairly interested where PostgreSQL is at today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan started out with explaining where he used replication the most,&lt;br /&gt;
For backups and    Specialized services  so he could offload long running and intrusive reporting tools to an isiolated server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While going over the history of Slony he also mentioned eRserver, first written in Perl later  rewritten  in Java and that was a ...   Well lets just say that memory usage wasn&#039;t really ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation covered different potential replication scenarios and the problems one could run into.&lt;br /&gt;
No sign however of multimaster replication.  Jan Wieck even told us he had no plans to implmenent multimaster replication&lt;br /&gt;
at all at the moment.   To me MultiMaster means that I can move my database connection together with my application service in a HA setup.  I don&#039;t need to wory about the possibility of writing in a slave and breaking replication  as the slave is also a master and the other node Will catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was a talk about openID, which made me realize a couple of things about it..  all off that in a separate post :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University restaurant was open and you could pay for your Chilli Con Carne to a really Grumpy cashier which brings me right to the next talk I followed..  A Developers Guide to Grumpy Old Sysadmins however, the majority of people in the room were Sysadmins , or people with a mixed role doing both development and sysadmin work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&#039;t let your developers even close to your production systems.  He then went on to read a fairly big part of &quot;Over Clocked,  Stories of the Future Present &quot; by Cory Doctorow ,  which I&#039;ve  promptly put on my holliday reading list :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&#039;s it like being a sysadmin ?  You get calls in the middle of the night because a system breaks,&lt;br /&gt;
When you work you .. people complain when things go wrong.. they don&#039;t cheer when things go right or when you have done your job correctly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of this situation at a customer where the Cisco people that fail to automate their work and  get to travel around the qworld to do  their work using their serial console , where as the Linux platform team has automated their work so far they get to stay home and watch the machines boot  then do a quick check over ssh to see if they actually work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow.. the talk really wasn&#039;t focusing on how developers could cooperate better with sysadmins, apart from a couple of general tips  so it really missed its goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I popped into the Lightning talk about Ubuntu on EEE talk , hoping to learn something, apart from 1 url that I should read I guess it was the otherway around  , it&#039;s usually a bad sign when a speaker starts every 2 slides with &quot;I haven&#039;t tested this myselve but &quot; ...&lt;/p&gt;
