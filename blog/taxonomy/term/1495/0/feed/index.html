 <title>Love, MonitoringLove</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/love-monitoringlove</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year we were pretty negative about Monitoring, We shouted out that MonitoringSucked ... A year has passed and a lot has changed ... most importantly our new found love for monitoring,  thanks to an inspirational Ignite talk by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ulfmansson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ulf Mansson&lt;/a&gt; at devopsdays Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after Fosdem about 20 people showed up at the #monitoringlove hacksessions hosted at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inuits.eu/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Inuits.eu&lt;/a&gt; offices to work on Open Source monitoring projects and exchange ideas.   Some completely new people,  some people with already a lot of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst the projects that were worked on was Maciej working on  Packaging graphite for Debian, Ohter people were fixing bugs in Puppet  , I spent some time with a  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/krisbuytaert/vagrant-sensu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vagrant box&lt;/a&gt; to deploy Sensu using Puppet.  Last time I was playing with Sensu was on the flight back from PuppetCon , I gave up the fight with&lt;br /&gt;
RabbitMQ and SSL because I had no internet connection .. and now Ulf just pointed out that I could disable SSL at all, which resulted in having a POC up and running in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick was  hacking on the Chef counterpart of the vagrant-puppet sensu setup a part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/monigusto&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;#monigusto&lt;/a&gt;. Ulf Mansson was getting &lt;a href=&quot;http://shopify.github.com/dashing/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dashing&lt;/a&gt; to display on a  Raspberry Pi  ... pretty cool stuff&lt;br /&gt;
And Jelle Smet was working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/smetj/pyseps&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pyseps&lt;/a&gt; a Python based Simple Event Processing Server framework that  consume JSON docs from RabbitMQ and forwards them real time to other queues using MongoDB query syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting discussion was around the topic of  alerting and modeling business rules and input from a lot of different sources&lt;br /&gt;
in order to send the right alerts to the right people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explored different ideas like using BPM tools such as Activity or Rules engines like Ruby Rools. There exist some Saas providers that try to solve this need like PagerDuty and friends but obviously there is still a lot of work that needs to be done in order to create a viable alerting system based on different input sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monitoring problem is not solved yet .. and it will stay around for a couple of years .. but with the advent of event such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://monitorama.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Monitorama&lt;/a&gt; its clear&lt;br /&gt;
that an event like our #monitoring love hackessions is needed .. and is probably here to stay for a couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
