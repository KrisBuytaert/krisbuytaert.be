 <title>Oracle installer didn&#039;t speed up in 8-9 years</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/454</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.oracle.com/wim/2007/09/20#a56&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Seklos&lt;/a&gt; just posted a story on his Oracle blog on how he installed Oracle 10something in less than an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the story hilarious.  why .  because about a decade ago .. when I was still into database &amp;amp; webdevelopment, Oracle first started shipping Oracle for Linus (somewhere in 99)&lt;br /&gt;
Back then some collegue  had been struggling for a couple of days already to setup up Oracle on a Windows box and was thinking to just use SQL server.&lt;br /&gt;
So I went home found the famous CD with the typo (or did I really get the CD that should have been shipped to Finland ?) in my mailbox and as I had a new Siemens Server sitting in my basement, I installed a fresh RedHat and on a machine I never had seen before (that&#039;s the ninetees I`m talking about so no fancy just install it on most common hardware and it will work like we have these days)  and then went on installing an Oracle version I had never seen before and guess what .. I completed that task in about just less than an hour.&lt;br /&gt;
So when I arrived at the office the next morning with an up and running Oracle on Linux server the crowd didn&#039;t believe me untll they fired up their SQLPlus clients and started creating their tablespaces and tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now about 8 years later it still takes an experienced Linux and Oracle guy about an hour to install a basic Oracle ? What have they been doing ? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bootstrap a fully operational MySQL server from blank disk to replying to queries in about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe I  should  move back to Oracle because as a consultant I get paid by the hour and if a similar job takes me about 10 times as long as I`m used to .. can you imagine ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all joking aside .. the problem isn&#039;t with Oracle, the problem isn&#039;t with RedHat and not all the solutions are with MySQL, the problem is with people with little or no system experience trying to do a job they should grow in to over time, and failing to get proper help or guidance their first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just one final thought.. with Unbreakable I really would have expected Oracle to go one step further not requiring the runInstaller thing anymore but just providing their customers with  cleanly packaged software so a yum or apt-get install oracle would actually work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because as &lt;a href=&quot;http://madstop.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Luke&lt;/a&gt; learned us . &lt;cite&gt;If your computer can&#039;t install it .. the installation procedure is broken.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
