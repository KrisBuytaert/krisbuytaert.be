 <title>Life with an Android</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/life-android</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve have never been a really an HTC fan, because of the platform they used before, I have been a Ericsson GA628, SH888, then Sony Ericsson fanboy for all my life  T39m, K700, K800i , so this is my first attempt into using a different brand of phone , I&#039;ve been wanting an Open Phone for ages.. but I&#039;ve been waiting for Godot, er the openMoko, for way to long now so with the introduction of the HTC and my K800i being long overdue for a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Good,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in gereral I`m pretty satisfied with my HTC Hero so far,  it&#039;s quick/reactive , the wifi has good reception ,  screen quality is good,  the touch screen however will take some time to get used to .. it already happened a couple of times that I accidently started calling the wrong person while I was still browing trough the addressbook.   But in short .. I like the phone ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However there&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://laforge.gnumonks.org/weblog/2009/11/04/#20091104-android_mythbusters&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;lots&lt;/a&gt; of people out there warning us that the Android isn&#039;t really an Open phone, true,  lots of the software on it is proprietary, and lots of the software in the Market is cripple or pay ware.  However imvho it&#039;s a step in the good direction going from a fully closed phone   so something already more open...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume button is to easy to use when in your pocket , hence putting the phone on silent by walking around is not unusable  and  Camera Autofocus is pretty bad .. no I&#039;m not comparing to my EOS 400D, but to my previos Ericsson phone.  the quality of the pictures is shaky  and there is no way to cover the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the The Ugly I&#039;d have to say Bluetooth support,   hey I want to be able to browse / download my addressbook from my Phone to my Bluetooth enabled car  , this is a feature I had on my previous phone, and the phone before that ..I want to be able to upload and download files over Bluetooth, works on both my previous phones , I want to be able to send phonebook entries over bluetooth .. so that&#039;s pretty much my biggest annoyancy&lt;br /&gt;
(unless someone knows solutions for this ?) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when will Sony Ericsson release their Android in Europe ?  I`m hoping they&#039;d keep the features they already had on their previous phones , so I`m hoping for better camera and better bluetooth support ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have come a long way for Linux to be present in our daily life , even for Joe Average,  at home we watch TV using MythTV, my alarm is a Chumby, the phone in my downstairs office is a TuxScreen ...  So I`m wondering when I finally will get a car that is running Linux,&lt;/p&gt;
