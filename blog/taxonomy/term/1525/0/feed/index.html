 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/upcoming-conferences</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After not being able to give my planned Ignite at #devopsdays Amsterdam because I was down with the flu here&#039;s some fresh opportunities to listen to my rants :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September I`ll be talking at  PuppetConf 2014, San Francisco , USA about some of the horror stories we went trough over the past couple of years when deploying infrastructure the automated fasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just one week later I`ll be opening the #devops track at DrupalCon Amsterdam  together with @cyberswat (Kevin Bridges) where we&#039;ll talk about the current state of #drupal and #devops ,  We&#039;ll be reopening the #drupal and #devops survey shortly, more info about that later here..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a couple of weeks later I will be ranting about Packaging software on Linux at  LinuxConf Europe in Dusseldorf, Germany&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in November , I`m headed to  Nuremberg, Germany where I will be opening the  Open Source Monitoring Conference  tinkering about the current state of Open Source Monitoring, do we love it .. or does it still suck :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s all ..&lt;br /&gt;
for now ..&lt;/p&gt;
