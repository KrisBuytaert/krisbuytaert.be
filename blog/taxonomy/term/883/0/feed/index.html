 <title>Dear Computer Futures</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/640</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Computer Futures,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please stop calling me,  I already told you folks ages ago I won&#039;t work with you. Back in 1999 you sent my resume to companies I specifically forbid you not to send  it to.  You called me to arrange interviews with one of your customers while I was already waiting in the lobby of that exact same customer your coworker sent me to, Twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no need in calling me again last week trying to convince me of working with you.   I know you compete with the guy sitting in the cubicle next to you and you have absolutely no idea what I`m doing or what I`m interested in , as you don&#039;t even bother to search the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most importantly do not try to call my customers switchboard to get in touch with me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume that have read and clearly understood my message  and will comply,&lt;br /&gt;
If you still really really feel the need to call me I will gladly accept your calls and invoice you at an appropriate rate for the time I waste.&lt;/p&gt;
