 <title>Option D</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/option-d</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of people writing about Snorkle again  today ,Monty &lt;a href=&quot;http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2009/12/help-saving-mysql.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Says, help saving MySQL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gives us different options, a , b or c .. but I , and some others, want an option d &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No I don&#039;t trust Oracle,  it&#039;s not like they have been a very good Open Source Citizen, yes they contribute to the kernel and other projects but my feeling says it&#039;s only because they have to (Kernel, Xen and others ) not because they Want to (thinking about Unfakable etc) , if they would really want to they probably would work with the CentOS community more etc, and as Monty mentions their InnoDB track record could be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand I don&#039;t think the EU should block the deal because Monty wants his baby back , cheap , as honestly imvho that&#039;s what they really want, be able to buy MySQL back for a nice price,  either beceause Oracle is being forced by the EU to split up Sun, or eventually the deal doesn&#039;t come trough and they can buy MySQL back when Sun really goes belly up (which is what probably happens when option a)  is chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/marketwire/0568514.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; , Oracle has made some pledges about MySQL earlier today.&lt;br /&gt;
My main question there however is about the Opposite of option 5.  which is exactly what created the problem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
5. Support not mandatory. Customers will not be required to purchase support services from Oracle as a condition to obtaining a commercial license to MySQL. &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes we want support, but no we don&#039;t want a commercial license with it, we want support on the GPL version, which is a problem lots of Open Source vendors struggle with , some of them&lt;br /&gt;
force people wanting to buy support to go for the commercial license.  And it is exaclty that  upselling  that  got MySQL in the troubles it has  today .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh Berkus has a point declaring&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/database-soup/snoracle-mysql-and-the-death-of-duallicensing-35850?rss=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dual Licensing dead&lt;/a&gt;, just as I he  sees much more future in the Percona like model than in the Dual License model MySQL used to have ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dries &lt;a href=&quot;http://pooteeweet.org/blog/0/1639#m1639&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; points&lt;/a&gt; to one of the comments  on&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/Dries/status/6660856340&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;  Lukas  Kahwe  Smith &#039;s Come On Money er Monty article&lt;/a&gt;  stating&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Monty walks away with several millions in hard cash, while [PHP +] MySQL cheerleaders who bet on &quot;MySQL&quot; franchise only walk away with a cute dolphin T-shirt&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which makes me wonder when I`ll be getting a nice Acquia T-shirt :)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Oracle, MySQL and the EU</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/oracle-mysql-and-eu</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://identi.ca/notice/7477327&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jan Wildeboer&lt;/a&gt; pointed us to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.thinkphp.de/archives/416-A-letter-from-the-European-commission-regarding-the-OracleSun-merger.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mayflower post&lt;/a&gt; about their letter from the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like the the European Commision , more specifically the Directorate General for Competition , really is interested in our input regarding the matter, I mailed them and also got a questionnaire to fill in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you have something interesting to tell them don&#039;t hesitate to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:Vera.POZZATO@ec.europa.eu&quot;&gt;contact them&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;
