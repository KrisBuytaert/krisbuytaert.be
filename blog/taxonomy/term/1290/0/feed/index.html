 <title>Open Source  Business Models</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/open-source-business-models</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There is once again a lot of fuzz going on about Open Source Business models,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openlogic.com/blogs/2009/09/customers-not-thrilled-with-open-source-business-models-preferred-by-many-vcs-open-source-companies/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;First on my eyballs was the article that Customers don&#039;t seem to like openCore&lt;/a&gt;  what a big &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adventuresinoss.com/?p=611&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;surprise ..  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#039;s not the one that makes the customers happy ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is the  other side of the coin, the people that create open source&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/2009/09/15/oracle-could-kill-off-mysql-but-probably-wont/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt; Authors realize the dual licensing model comes hunting back at you &lt;/a&gt; after a merger or a hostile acquisition,   yes they still have the source code to build on  but they can&#039;t  sell commercial licenses to their customers anymore they way they used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#039;s not the one that eventually makes the authors happy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is the RedHat model,  which tends to please a lot of people, which tends to be something traditional IT resellers can take in their portofolio, but partnering with a RedHat style company as an open source expert consultancy company isn&#039;t easy , as the expert consultancy companies have the knowledge themselves and won&#039;t push reselling subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that doesn&#039;t make the Distribution Vendors  happy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when XenSource came on the market we asked them if they could help us supporting some of our customers with Xen deployments, they didn&#039;t care they wanted to build a product and a fast exit ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That didn&#039;t make us as an integrator nor the customer happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#039;d think us opensource folks are really unhappy wouldn&#039;t you ?&lt;br /&gt;
Wrong.. as we are all in it ..  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_for_Fun&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Just for Fun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the money!&lt;/p&gt;
