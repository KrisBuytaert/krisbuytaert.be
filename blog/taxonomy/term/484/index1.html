<p>Drupal has one of the biggest development communities in the open source world,  being part of both communities  We are  trying to bridge the gap,</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.inuits.eu/" rel="nofollow">Inuits</a> we are building tools and writing best practices to close the gap,  but we are not alone in this world and we would like to gather some feedback on how other people are deploying, and managing their Drupal environments</p>
<p>Working with Drupal, build with Drupal in mind .. how do you release your sites ..  That's what we are trying to figure out ... for everybody else to learn from</p>

        </div>
  <div class="content"><p>For those who haven't noticed yet .. I`m into devops  .. I`m also a little bit into Drupal, (blame my last name..)  ,  so one of the frustrations I've been having with Drupal (an much other software) is the automation of deployment and upgrades of Drupal sites ... </p>
<p>So for the past couple of days  I've been trying to catch up to the ongoing discussion regarding the results of the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/155559" rel="nofollow">configuration mgmt  sprint</a> , I've been looking at it mainly from a systems point of view , being  with the use of Puppet/ Chef or similar tools in mind ..  I know I`m late to the discussion but hey , some people take holidays in this season :)   So below you can read a bunch of my comments ... and thoughts on the topic ..</p>
<p>First of all , to me JSON looks like a valid option.<br />
Initially there was the plan to wrap the JSON in a PHP header for "security" reasons, but that seems to be gone even while nobody mentioned the problems that would have been caused for external configuration management tools.<br />
When thinking about external tools that should be capable of mangling the file plenty of them support JSON but won't be able to recognize a JSON file with a weird header ( thinking e.g about Augeas  (augeas.net) , I`m not talking about IDE's , GUI's etc  here, I`m talking about system level tools and libraries  that are designed to mangle standard files.   For Augeas we could create a separate lens to manage these files , but other tools might have bigger problems with the concept.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/155559#comment-520134" rel="nofollow">catch</a> suggest a clean .htaccess should be capable of preventing people to access the .json files  There's other methods to figure out if files have been tampered with , not sure if this even fits within Drupal  (I`m thinking about reusing existing CA setups rather than having yet another security setup to manage) , </p>
<p>In general to me tools such as puppet should be capable of modifying config files , and then activating that config with no human interaction required , obviously drush is a good candidate here to trigger the system after the config files have been change, but unlike some people think having to browse to a web page to confirm the changes is not an acceptable solution.  Just think about having to do this on multiple environments ... manual actions are error prone.. </p>
<p>Apart from that I also think the storing of the certificates should not be part of the file.  What about a meta file with the appropriate checksums ?  (Also if I`m using Puppet or any other tool to manage my config files then the security , preventing to tamper these  files, is already covered by the configuration management tools,  I do understand that people want to build Drupal in the most secure way possible, but I don't think this belongs in any web application.  </p>
<p>When I look at other similar discussions that wanted to provide a similar secure setup they ran into a lot of end user problems with these kind of setups,  an alternative approach is to make this configurable and or plugable.   The default approach should be to have it enable, but the more experienced users should have the opportunity to disable this, or replace it with another framework.   Making it plugable upfront solves a lot of hassle later.</p>
<p>Someone in the discussion noted :<br />
"One simple suggestion for enhancing security might be to make it possible to omit the secret key file and require the user to enter the key into the UI or drush in order to load configuration from disk."</p>
<p>Requiring the user to enter a key in the UI or drush would be counterproductive in the goal one wants to achieve,  the last thing you want as a requirement is manual/human interaction when automating setups.   therefore a feature like this should never be implemented  </p>
<p>Luckily there seems to be  new idea around <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/157379" rel="nofollow">that</a> doesn't plan on using a raped json file<br />
<cite>instead of storing the config files in a standard place, we store them in a directory that is named using a hash of your site's private key, like sites/default/config_723fd490de3fb7203c3a408abee8c0bf3c2d302392. The files in this directory would still be protected via .htaccess/web.config, but if that protection failed then the files would still be essentially impossible to find. This means we could store pure, native .json files everywhere instead, to still bring the benefits of JSON (human editable, syntax checkable, interoperability with external configuration management tools, native + speedy encoding/decoding functions), without the confusing and controversial PHP wrapper.</cite></p>
<p>Figuring out the directory name for the configs from a configuration mgmt tool then could be done by something similar to  </p>
<p><div class="geshifilter"><pre class="text geshifilter-text" style="font-family:monospace;"><ol><li style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal;"><div style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal">cd sites/default/conf/$(ls sites/default/conf|head -1)</div></li></ol></pre></div></p>
<p>In general I think the proposed setup looks acceptable , it definitely goes in the right direction of providing systems people with a way to automate the deployment of Drupal sites and applications at scale.</p>
<p>I`ll be keeping a eye on both the direction they are heading into and the evolution of the code !</p>

  <div class="content"><p>A couple of weeks ago I noticed a weird drop in web usage stats on the site you are browsing now.  Kinda weird as the drop was right around Fosdem when usually there is a spike in traffic.  <img src="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/images/PiwiwFail.png" /></p>
<p>So before you start.. no I don't preach on practice on my own blog,   it's a blog dammit,  so I do the occasional upgrades on the actual platform , with backups available, do some sanity tests and move on,  yes I break the theme pretty often but ya'll reading this trough RSS anyhow.</p>
<p>My backups showed me that drush had made a copy of the Piwik module somewhere early february, exactly when this drop started showing.   I verified the module , I verified my Piwik , - Oh Piwik you say .. yes Piwik, if you want a free alternative to Google Analytics , Piwik rocks ..  -   I even checked other sites using the same piwik setup and they were all still functional happily humming and being analyzed.... everything fine ...    but traffic stayed low ..</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/node/1052430">This</a> taught me I actually had to upgrade my Piwik too ...</p>
<p>So that brings me to the point I`m actually wanting to make...<br />
as according to @patrickdebois  in his chapter on Monitoring "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?" who's monitoring the monitoring tools, who's monitoring the analytics tools,  </p>
<p>So not only should you monitor the availability of yor monitoring tools, you should also monitor if their api hasn't changed in some way or another.<br />
Just like when you are monitoring an web app you shoulnd't just see if you can connect to the appropriate http port, but you should be checking if you get sensible results back from it , no gibberish.</p>
<p>But then again ... there's no revenue in my blog or its statistics :)</p>

<p>Next weekend saturday  I`ll be giving a talk about devops at <a href="http://brussels.startupweekend.org/speakers/" rel="nofollow">StartUp Weekend Brussels</a>, from what I've read so far  it promises to be an audience that needs the talk, </p>
<p>The week after I`ll be speaking at the <a href="http://bxl2011.drupaldays.org/node/233" rel="nofollow">DrupalDevDays</a>,  again about devops , however this time with a touch of Drupal  ,  giving a devops talk at Devoxx last year to a Java audience learned me that the devops evangelist  need to  go outside of their usual  conference audiences and als talk to the people that are usually in the other silos. </p>
<p>Next march   I`ll be speaking at the <a href="http://www.ukuug.org/events/spring2011/programme/" rel="nofollow">UKUUG spring conference in Leeds</a>  this time about my experiences on High Availability with Pacemaker</p>
<p>And who knows I might squeeze in a talk at <a href="http://loadays.org/" rel="nofollow">Load</a> this year also .. </p>
<p>If you are around at one of these confs and you want to talk Devops, Clustering, sipx or just have a beer .. don't hesitate !  There's already <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jpmens/status/28483625066430464" rel="nofollow">plenty of people</a> promising me beers , and some even sushi :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>When I first started out giving talks about devops ,  I realized that I was preaching to the choir,  some Barcamps,  the Keynote at Loadays , the Dutch Unix Usergroup etc .. lots of people in the audiences knew about the pains we were trying to solve, lots of them already knew some of the tools we use  and lots of them already talk a lot with their developers or are part of the deveoplment teams</p>
<p>With <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/from-devops-to-devops-what-a-difference-one-character-makes" rel="nofollow">our</a> Devoxx talk, Patrick and I started to talk to a different audience , the Java devs , and it was great, we all learned from it.  With that experience in mind I submitted a variation of the talk to an audience that is also very  important to me ...  the Drupal Community .</p>
<p>Devops is gaining importance , while <a href="http://inuits.be/">we</a> been practicing devops methodologies since ever, now even the big analyst companies etc are writing and talking about the movement,  the drupal community really should also get involved.</p>
<p>So if you care about devops,  about devs and ops working together, about continuous integration, continuous deployment, configuration mangement, automation, monitoring and scale, if you've heard about all of the above but have no clue what Puppet, Hudson or Fabric can do for you , <a href="http://chicago2011.drupal.org/sessions/devops-and-drupal" rel="nofollow">vote</a> here for my proposed talk at Drupalcon Chicago,</p>

I was still accepting comments, only they were never submitted to the database and after entering a comment to my blog people  ended up on a white page.</p>
<p>So upon returning from holliday I set out to debug the issue together with one of our Inuits Drupal geeks and quickly ran into the following error.<br />

I downgraded views again to 6.x-2.11  and Mollom started showing its Captcha's etc  again .</p>
<p>So apart from wondering how I ended up installing that alpha3 version (I`m sure Drush didn't do that), all is back to normal. and you should be able to comment on this blog again</p>

  <div class="content"><p>So <a href="http://bitfieldconsulting.com/puppet-drupal" rel="nofollow">John</a> wrote down his experiences on deploying Drupal sites with Puppet .</p>
<p>It's not a secret that I've been thinking about similar stuff and how I could get to the best possible setup.</p>
<p>John starts of with using Puppet to download Drush... while I want to use <a href="http://repo.inuits.be/centos/5/os/noarch/drush-All-Versions-2.1-1.noarch.rpm" rel="nofollow">rpm</a>  for that ...</p>
<p>I want my core infrastructure to be fully packaged... not downloaded and untarred.  I want to be able to reproduce my platform in a couple of months , with the exact same versions I`m using now .. not with the version that happens to be on ftp.drupal.org at that point in time, or with ftp.drupal.org being down.</p>
<p>Now the next question off course is what's the core infrastructure.<br />
Where does the infrastructure end and does the application start. There's little discussion about having a  puppet created vhost ,  an apache conf.d file, a matching .htaccess file if wanted , and the appropriate settings.php for a multisite drupal config.</p>
<p>There's also little doubt to me on using drush to run the updates, manage the drupal site etc . Reading John's  article made me think some further about what and when I want things packaged. </p>
<p>John's post lead to a discussion on #infra-talk on getting all drupal modules packaged for Centos with <a href="http://www.karan.org/blog/" rel="nofollow">Karan</a> and some others</p>
<p>In a development environment I probably want to have periodic drush updates getting the latest modules from the interwebs and potentially breaking my devs code.   But making sure that when you put a site in production it will be on a fairly up to date platform, and not on the platform you started developing on 24 months ago.</p>
<p>In a production environment however you  only want tested updates of your modules as indeed they will break code.</p>
<p>It's probably going to be a mix and match setup having a local rpm/deb repo with packaged  modules that have been tested and validated in your setup  and using drush to enable  or configure them for that  production setup.</p>
<p>But also having a CI environment wher Drush will get the new modules from the interwebs when needed.  and package them for you.</p>
<p>To me that sounds beter than getting all the available Drupal modules and packaging them, even automated, and preparing a repository of those modules of which only a small percentage will actually be used by people.</p>
<p>But I need to think about it some more :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Fosdem 2010 was my  10th  fosdem Edition (including the first OSDEM)<br />
As every year Fosdem suffered even more from it's own success.</p>
<p>On Friday evening  ther was the obligatory Beer event... however as  people need to eat to .. the Devops crowd fled the scene</p>
<p>I had made reservations for a 20 something group and with the CentOS crowd joining us (as there was some overlap anyhow) we were 25 when we arrived in the restaurant .<br />
<img src="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/images/DevopsMeet.jpg" /></p>
<p>Dinner and Discussions were great .. I learned about some new projects and we had some insightfull dicussions on how fat your thin foil should be ...</p>
<p>After dinner we went back to the Beer Event were lots of Free Beer was tasted ...</p>
<p>Saturday was the first full day of Fosdem,  as usual Fosdem was the victim of it's own success  , too much interresting stuff to see .. too little time.</p>
<p>Lots of Devrooms had the "FULL" sign put up more than you want as a visitor ...<br />
I never even made it into the Drupal or NoSQL rooms :(</p>
<p>Sadly I had to correct  <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/20962834">Ploum</a>'s first law  but for a lot of people .. Fosdem each time means the battle choosing which presentation you'll go to ...   If you can even make it to the talk .. as usually the the hallway track is much more interresting :)</p>
<p><img src="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/images/MySQLMeetup.jpg" /></p>
<p>The MySQL devroom was on sunday but on saturday the crowd met in an Italian place nearby the Fosdem campus to get to know each other and chat a lot ..<br />
The discussions ranged from French vs Canadaian and the future of Forks</p>
<p>During Saturday afternoon <a href="http://twitter.com/patrickdebois">@patrickdebois</a> suggested a Devops Meetup for Breakfast ...   and some how that also happened ...</p>
<p>When I arrived at Fosdem on sunday morning  they were still there :)<br />
<img src="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/images/DevopsBrkFast.jpg" /><br />
I spent the biggest part of Sunday in and around the MySQL devroom listening to a bunch of interresting talks</p>
<p>My own talk  went fairly well given the time constraint ..   sqeezing content for an hour in 20 minutes means you can't really go deep into the topics ...<br />
My initial plan was to only focus on Pacemaker integration however the community had voted for the overview talk :)</p>
