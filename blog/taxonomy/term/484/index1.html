        </div>
  <div class="content"><p>I`m parsing the responses of the Deploying Drupal survey  I started a couple of months ago (more on that later) </p>
<p>One of the questions in the survey is "What is devops" , apparently when you ask a zillion people (ok ok, just a large bunch of Tweeps..),  you get a large amount of different answers ranging from totally wrong to  spot on.</p>
<p>So let's go over them  and see what we can learn from them .. </p>
<p>The most Wrong definition one can give is probably : </p>
<ul>
<li> A buzzword
</li></ul>
<p>I think we've long passed the buzzword phase, definitely since it's not new, it's a new term we put to an existing practice.  A new term that gives a lot of people that were already doing devops , a common word to dicuss about it. Also lots of people still seem to think that devops is a specific role,  a job description , that it points to a specific group of people doing a certain job, it's not . Yes you'll see a lot of organisations  looing for  devops people,  and giving them a  devops job title.  But  it's kinda hard to be the only one doing devops in an organisation.</p>
<p>I described one of my current roles as Devops Kickstarter, it pretty much describes what I`m doing and it does contain devops :) </p>
<p>But devops also isn't </p>
<ul>
<li>The connection between operations and development.
</li><li>people that keep it running
</li><li>crazy little fellows who find beauty in black/white letters( aka code) rather than a view like that of Taj in a full moon light.
</li><li>the combination of developer and operations into one overall functionality
</li><li>The perfect mixture between a developer and a system engineer. Someone who can optimize and simplify certain flows that are required by developers and system engineers, but sometimes are just outside of the scope for both of them.
</li><li>Proxy between developer and management
</li><li>The people in charge of the build/release cycle and planning.
</li><li>A creature, made from 8-bit cells, with the knowledge of a seasoned developer, the skillset of a trained systems engineer and the perseverence of a true hacker.
</li><li>The people filling the gap between the developer world and the sysadmin world. They understand dev. issues and system issues as well. They use tools from both world to solve them.
</li></ul>
<p>Or</p>
<ul>
<li> Developers looking at the operations of the company and how we can save the company time and money
</li></ul>
<p>And it's definitely not </p>
<ul>
<li> Someone who mixes both a sysop and dev duties
</li><li> developers who know how to deploy and manage sites, including content and configuration.
</li><li>I believe there's a thin line line between Ops and Devs where we need to do parts of each others jobs (or at least try) to reach our common goal..
</li><li> A developer that creates and maintains environments tools to help other developers be more successful in building and  releasing new products
</li><li> Developers who also do IT operations, or visa versa.
</li><li> Software developers that support development teams and assist with infrastructure systems
</li></ul>
<p>So no,  developers that take on systems roles next to their own role and want to go for NoOps isn't feasable at all ..you really want collaboration, you want people with  different skillsets that (try to) understand eachoter and (try to) work together towards a common goal. </p>
<p>Devops is also not  just infrastructure as code </p>
<ul>
<li>Writing software to manage operations
</li><li>system administrators with a development culture.
</li><li>Bring code management to operations, automating system admin tasks.
</li><li>The melding of the art of Systems Administration and the skill of development with a focus on automation. A side effect of devops is the tearing down of the virtual wall that has existed between SA's and developers.
</li><li>Infrastructure as code.
</li><li>Applying some of the development worlds techniques (eg source control, builds, testing etc) to the operations world.
</li><li> Code for infrastructure
</li></ul>
<p>Sure infastructure as code is a big part of the Automation part listed in CAMS, but just because you are doing puppet/chef doesn't mean you are doing devops.<br />
Devops is also not  just  continous delivery</p>
<ul>
<li>A way to let operations deploy sites in regular intervals to enable developers to interact on the systems earlier and make deployments easier.
</li><li>Devops is the process of how you go from development to release.
</li></ul>
<p>Obviously lots of people doing devops also often try to achieve Continuous delivery, but just like Infrastructure as Code it devops is not limited to that :) </p>
<p>But I guess the truth is somewhere in the definitions below ... </p>
<ul>
<li>That sweet spot between "operating system" or platform stack and the application layer. It is wanting sys admins who are willing to go beyond the normal package installers, and developers who know how to make their platform hum with their application.
</li><li> Breaking the wall between dev and ops in the same way agile breaks the wall between business and dev e.g. coming to terms with changing requirements, iterative cycles
</li><li> Not being an arsehole!
</li><li> Sysadmin best-practise, using configuration as code, and facilitating communication between sysadmins and developers, with each understanding and participating in the activities of the other.
</li><li> Devops is both the process of developers and system operators working closer together, as well as people who know (or who have worked in) both development and system operations.
</li><li> Culture collaboration, tool-chains
</li><li> Removing barriers to communication and efficiency through shared vocabulary, ideals, and business objectives to to deliver value.
</li><li> A set of principles and good practices to improve the interactions between Operations and Development.
</li><li> Collaboration between developers and sysadmins to work towards more reliable platforms
</li><li> Building a bridge between development and operations
</li><li> The systematic process of building, deploying, managing, and using an application or group of applications such as a drupal site.
</li><li> Devops is collaboration and Integration between Software Development and System Administration.
</li><li> Devops is an emerging set of principles, methods and practices for communication, collaboration and integration between software development (application/software engineering) and IT operations (systems administration/infrastructure) professionals.[1] It has developed in response to the emerging understanding of the interdependence and importance of both the development and operations disciplines in meeting an organization's goal of rapidly producing software products and services.
</li><li> bringing together technology (development) &amp; content (management) closer together
</li><li> Making developers and admins understand each other.
</li><li> Communication between developers and systems folk.
</li><li> a cultural movement to improve agility between dev and ops
</li><li> The cultural extension of agile to bring operations into development teams.
</li><li> Tight collaboration of developers, operations team (sys admins) and QA-team.
</li></ul>
<p>But I can only conclude that there is a huge amount of evangelisation that still needs to be done,  Lots of people still don't understand what devops is , or have a totally different view on it. </p>
<p>A number of technology conferences are and have taken up devops as a part of their conference program,  inviting experienced people from outside of their focus field to talk about how they improve the quality of life !</p>
<p>There is still a large number of devops related problems to solve,  so that's what I`ll be doing in 2012</p>

        </div>
  <div class="content"><p>For those who haven't noticed yet .. I`m into devops  .. I`m also a little bit into Drupal, (blame my last name..)  ,  so one of the frustrations I've been having with Drupal (an much other software) is the automation of deployment and upgrades of Drupal sites ... </p>
<p>So for the past couple of days  I've been trying to catch up to the ongoing discussion regarding the results of the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/155559" rel="nofollow">configuration mgmt  sprint</a> , I've been looking at it mainly from a systems point of view , being  with the use of Puppet/ Chef or similar tools in mind ..  I know I`m late to the discussion but hey , some people take holidays in this season :)   So below you can read a bunch of my comments ... and thoughts on the topic ..</p>
<p>First of all , to me JSON looks like a valid option.<br />
Initially there was the plan to wrap the JSON in a PHP header for "security" reasons, but that seems to be gone even while nobody mentioned the problems that would have been caused for external configuration management tools.<br />
When thinking about external tools that should be capable of mangling the file plenty of them support JSON but won't be able to recognize a JSON file with a weird header ( thinking e.g about Augeas  (augeas.net) , I`m not talking about IDE's , GUI's etc  here, I`m talking about system level tools and libraries  that are designed to mangle standard files.   For Augeas we could create a separate lens to manage these files , but other tools might have bigger problems with the concept.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/155559#comment-520134" rel="nofollow">catch</a> suggest a clean .htaccess should be capable of preventing people to access the .json files  There's other methods to figure out if files have been tampered with , not sure if this even fits within Drupal  (I`m thinking about reusing existing CA setups rather than having yet another security setup to manage) , </p>
<p>In general to me tools such as puppet should be capable of modifying config files , and then activating that config with no human interaction required , obviously drush is a good candidate here to trigger the system after the config files have been change, but unlike some people think having to browse to a web page to confirm the changes is not an acceptable solution.  Just think about having to do this on multiple environments ... manual actions are error prone.. </p>
<p>Apart from that I also think the storing of the certificates should not be part of the file.  What about a meta file with the appropriate checksums ?  (Also if I`m using Puppet or any other tool to manage my config files then the security , preventing to tamper these  files, is already covered by the configuration management tools,  I do understand that people want to build Drupal in the most secure way possible, but I don't think this belongs in any web application.  </p>
<p>When I look at other similar discussions that wanted to provide a similar secure setup they ran into a lot of end user problems with these kind of setups,  an alternative approach is to make this configurable and or plugable.   The default approach should be to have it enable, but the more experienced users should have the opportunity to disable this, or replace it with another framework.   Making it plugable upfront solves a lot of hassle later.</p>
<p>Someone in the discussion noted :<br />
"One simple suggestion for enhancing security might be to make it possible to omit the secret key file and require the user to enter the key into the UI or drush in order to load configuration from disk."</p>
<p>Requiring the user to enter a key in the UI or drush would be counterproductive in the goal one wants to achieve,  the last thing you want as a requirement is manual/human interaction when automating setups.   therefore a feature like this should never be implemented  </p>
<p>Luckily there seems to be  new idea around <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/157379" rel="nofollow">that</a> doesn't plan on using a raped json file<br />
<cite>instead of storing the config files in a standard place, we store them in a directory that is named using a hash of your site's private key, like sites/default/config_723fd490de3fb7203c3a408abee8c0bf3c2d302392. The files in this directory would still be protected via .htaccess/web.config, but if that protection failed then the files would still be essentially impossible to find. This means we could store pure, native .json files everywhere instead, to still bring the benefits of JSON (human editable, syntax checkable, interoperability with external configuration management tools, native + speedy encoding/decoding functions), without the confusing and controversial PHP wrapper.</cite></p>
<p>Figuring out the directory name for the configs from a configuration mgmt tool then could be done by something similar to  </p>
<p><div class="geshifilter"><pre class="text geshifilter-text" style="font-family:monospace;"><ol><li style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal;"><div style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal">cd sites/default/conf/$(ls sites/default/conf|head -1)</div></li></ol></pre></div></p>
<p>In general I think the proposed setup looks acceptable , it definitely goes in the right direction of providing systems people with a way to automate the deployment of Drupal sites and applications at scale.</p>
<p>I`ll be keeping a eye on both the direction they are heading into and the evolution of the code !</p>

  <div class="content"><p>A couple of weeks ago I noticed a weird drop in web usage stats on the site you are browsing now.  Kinda weird as the drop was right around Fosdem when usually there is a spike in traffic.  <img src="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/images/PiwiwFail.png" /></p>
<p>So before you start.. no I don't preach on practice on my own blog,   it's a blog dammit,  so I do the occasional upgrades on the actual platform , with backups available, do some sanity tests and move on,  yes I break the theme pretty often but ya'll reading this trough RSS anyhow.</p>
<p>My backups showed me that drush had made a copy of the Piwik module somewhere early february, exactly when this drop started showing.   I verified the module , I verified my Piwik , - Oh Piwik you say .. yes Piwik, if you want a free alternative to Google Analytics , Piwik rocks ..  -   I even checked other sites using the same piwik setup and they were all still functional happily humming and being analyzed.... everything fine ...    but traffic stayed low ..</p>
<p><a href="http://drupal.org/node/1052430">This</a> taught me I actually had to upgrade my Piwik too ...</p>
<p>So that brings me to the point I`m actually wanting to make...<br />
as according to @patrickdebois  in his chapter on Monitoring "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?" who's monitoring the monitoring tools, who's monitoring the analytics tools,  </p>
<p>So not only should you monitor the availability of yor monitoring tools, you should also monitor if their api hasn't changed in some way or another.<br />
Just like when you are monitoring an web app you shoulnd't just see if you can connect to the appropriate http port, but you should be checking if you get sensible results back from it , no gibberish.</p>
<p>But then again ... there's no revenue in my blog or its statistics :)</p>

<p>Next weekend saturday  I`ll be giving a talk about devops at <a href="http://brussels.startupweekend.org/speakers/" rel="nofollow">StartUp Weekend Brussels</a>, from what I've read so far  it promises to be an audience that needs the talk, </p>
<p>The week after I`ll be speaking at the <a href="http://bxl2011.drupaldays.org/node/233" rel="nofollow">DrupalDevDays</a>,  again about devops , however this time with a touch of Drupal  ,  giving a devops talk at Devoxx last year to a Java audience learned me that the devops evangelist  need to  go outside of their usual  conference audiences and als talk to the people that are usually in the other silos. </p>
<p>Next march   I`ll be speaking at the <a href="http://www.ukuug.org/events/spring2011/programme/" rel="nofollow">UKUUG spring conference in Leeds</a>  this time about my experiences on High Availability with Pacemaker</p>
<p>And who knows I might squeeze in a talk at <a href="http://loadays.org/" rel="nofollow">Load</a> this year also .. </p>
<p>If you are around at one of these confs and you want to talk Devops, Clustering, sipx or just have a beer .. don't hesitate !  There's already <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jpmens/status/28483625066430464" rel="nofollow">plenty of people</a> promising me beers , and some even sushi :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>When I first started out giving talks about devops ,  I realized that I was preaching to the choir,  some Barcamps,  the Keynote at Loadays , the Dutch Unix Usergroup etc .. lots of people in the audiences knew about the pains we were trying to solve, lots of them already knew some of the tools we use  and lots of them already talk a lot with their developers or are part of the deveoplment teams</p>
<p>With <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jedi4ever/from-devops-to-devops-what-a-difference-one-character-makes" rel="nofollow">our</a> Devoxx talk, Patrick and I started to talk to a different audience , the Java devs , and it was great, we all learned from it.  With that experience in mind I submitted a variation of the talk to an audience that is also very  important to me ...  the Drupal Community .</p>
<p>Devops is gaining importance , while <a href="http://inuits.be/">we</a> been practicing devops methodologies since ever, now even the big analyst companies etc are writing and talking about the movement,  the drupal community really should also get involved.</p>
<p>So if you care about devops,  about devs and ops working together, about continuous integration, continuous deployment, configuration mangement, automation, monitoring and scale, if you've heard about all of the above but have no clue what Puppet, Hudson or Fabric can do for you , <a href="http://chicago2011.drupal.org/sessions/devops-and-drupal" rel="nofollow">vote</a> here for my proposed talk at Drupalcon Chicago,</p>

  <div class="content"><p>You might have noticed that this blog stopped accepting comments about a month ago.. well. stopped accepting is a big word.. I was still accepting comments, only they were never submitted to the database and after entering a comment to my blog people  ended up on a white page.</p>
<p>So upon returning from holliday I set out to debug the issue together with one of our Inuits Drupal geeks and quickly ran into the following error.<br />
<div class="geshifilter"><pre class="text geshifilter-text" style="font-family:monospace;"><ol><li style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal;"><div style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal">PHP Fatal error:  Call to a member function has_more_records() on a non-object in /somepath/modules/views/plugins/views_plugin_display.inc on line 1992, referer: http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/comment/reply/1014</div></li></ol></pre></div></p>
<p>So apparently my veasion of views  6.x-3.0-alpha3 didn't really like to play with Mollom,<br />
I downgraded views again to 6.x-2.11  and Mollom started showing its Captcha's etc  again .</p>
<p>So apart from wondering how I ended up installing that alpha3 version (I`m sure Drush didn't do that), all is back to normal. and you should be able to comment on this blog again</p>

  <div class="content"><p>So <a href="http://bitfieldconsulting.com/puppet-drupal" rel="nofollow">John</a> wrote down his experiences on deploying Drupal sites with Puppet .</p>
<p>It's not a secret that I've been thinking about similar stuff and how I could get to the best possible setup.</p>
<p>John starts of with using Puppet to download Drush... while I want to use <a href="http://repo.inuits.be/centos/5/os/noarch/drush-All-Versions-2.1-1.noarch.rpm" rel="nofollow">rpm</a>  for that ...</p>
<p>I want my core infrastructure to be fully packaged... not downloaded and untarred.  I want to be able to reproduce my platform in a couple of months , with the exact same versions I`m using now .. not with the version that happens to be on ftp.drupal.org at that point in time, or with ftp.drupal.org being down.</p>
<p>Now the next question off course is what's the core infrastructure.<br />
Where does the infrastructure end and does the application start. There's little discussion about having a  puppet created vhost ,  an apache conf.d file, a matching .htaccess file if wanted , and the appropriate settings.php for a multisite drupal config.</p>
<p>There's also little doubt to me on using drush to run the updates, manage the drupal site etc . Reading John's  article made me think some further about what and when I want things packaged. </p>
<p>John's post lead to a discussion on #infra-talk on getting all drupal modules packaged for Centos with <a href="http://www.karan.org/blog/" rel="nofollow">Karan</a> and some others</p>
<p>In a development environment I probably want to have periodic drush updates getting the latest modules from the interwebs and potentially breaking my devs code.   But making sure that when you put a site in production it will be on a fairly up to date platform, and not on the platform you started developing on 24 months ago.</p>
<p>In a production environment however you  only want tested updates of your modules as indeed they will break code.</p>
<p>It's probably going to be a mix and match setup having a local rpm/deb repo with packaged  modules that have been tested and validated in your setup  and using drush to enable  or configure them for that  production setup.</p>
<p>But also having a CI environment wher Drush will get the new modules from the interwebs when needed.  and package them for you.</p>
<p>To me that sounds beter than getting all the available Drupal modules and packaging them, even automated, and preparing a repository of those modules of which only a small percentage will actually be used by people.</p>
<p>But I need to think about it some more :)</p>
