 <title>I  hate it when the marketeers take over</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/507</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tarrysingh.blogspot.com/2007/11/is-oracle-on-good-start-with.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tarry&lt;/a&gt; has an overview of the commentaries about Oracles latest Virtualisation announcement.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things hit my brainwaves,  First ,seemingly Larry is claiming that his Xen package is better than&lt;br /&gt;
the others since he supports Live Migration and all the others don&#039;t.  I don&#039;t know where he gets the idea..  I have to admit I don&#039;t remember which year it was .. but it was somewhere in december that I first starting with Live Migratiion of Xen machines and it was also on a CentOS platform. No fancy gui,  no hardcover manuals that had it all documented.  But fast  and seamlessly working live migration,  ready for everybody to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second one is he claming that since Xen was re-engineered  by Oracle  to be faster than the competition.&lt;br /&gt;
The way you read it there is that Oracle took Xen, modified it then started redistributing it.&lt;br /&gt;
Is that really what happened ?    Are they redistributing the source, or are they violating the GPL ?  Coz if they are&lt;br /&gt;
redistributing the source everybody just got a faster Xen and if they aren&#039;t ..&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#039;t know but there sure is room for rumour here.  Or is this just  a bunch of marketing people and IT journalist that are mispresenting the facts.   Fact is that one needs to spend lots of time verifying the facts of stories one read on the internet today.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I`m also seeing people crying that Oracle is finally stepping to the open source side.. .. I`m wondering on which planet they have been living.. Oracle has been supporting different Open Source products for ages already and they even are the owners of core components of typical daily used packages,  so where do those authors get the idea that Oracle is finally stepping over ? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I don&#039;t have time to go and hunt back the original sources and see who actually said what  .  Honestly I don&#039;t care that much about Unbreakable,  Last time I tried caring was when one of my european customers was interested in it, and no one at Oracle.be could help me .    It&#039;s Like Dell shipping Ubuntu.. not on this part of the world.. and sadly it&#039;s also like the OLPC .. Give one Get one  only on the other side of the Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s all good marketing .. until you actually want to get it .. :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just give me the source code .. then I don&#039;t have to sit trough presentations from marketing people that can only  read from spec sheets for some product , but fail to read the fine print and leave me  disappointed again ...&lt;/p&gt;
