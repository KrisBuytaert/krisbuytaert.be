 <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is long overdue,  as the idea  struck me when dicussing with  &lt;a href=&quot;http://lefred.be&quot;&gt;Lefred&lt;/a&gt;  while preparing his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lefred.be/?q=node/113&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Fosdem talk&lt;/a&gt; on Maintaining too big tables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got triggered finishing this post by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.build-doctor.com/2010/03/09/devops-is-a-good-cause-but-what-about-opsops/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mr BuidlDoctor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fred has been struggling with a typical DevOps problem resulting in the most unmanageable database setup possible,  there&#039;s little room for him to move but he managed is way out .. because he is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/apparently-devops-not-jobtitle#comment-3992&quot;&gt;good at his job&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It set the mark for me that because in different organisations even the Opsteam is fragmented `in different groups that there also we need to get the Devops idea going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical setups here are the Network guys vs the Platform guys , specially  with the growth of virtualization where the network stack doesn&#039;t stop at the physcial switchport anymore but the vlan trunks go deep in to the VM&#039;s a lot of discussion happens.  There where traditionally the story for the network engineer stopped at the switch they now want control much deeper in the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But an even bigger group that needs integration are the security folks,  it&#039;s no secret that in some organisations the security guys job is to be the bad guy, their default reply to something is NO.    Specially to people wanting to drill holes in their architecture .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/patrickdebois/status/10231971738&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Patrick&lt;/a&gt; wonders if its the specialist vs generalist dillemma,  I think it&#039;s the  Web vs Enterprise IT way of thinking ..&lt;br /&gt;
DevOps first gained ground in Web environments , the battle has only started ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still have a long way to go before in say a banking environment the Devs and SecOffs&#039; and the DBA&#039;s and the  Ops are on the same line ...   they all need to break the walls of confusion, they all need to come out of their silos.   And when you are a generalist in charge of a bunch of these things you have to make sure your tuesday afernoon security persona talks with his other persona&#039;s from time to time ... otherwise you are really gonna need those meds :)&lt;/p&gt;
