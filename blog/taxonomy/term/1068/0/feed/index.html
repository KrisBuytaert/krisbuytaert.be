 <title>I wrote more books than I remember</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/747</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well kinda, I contributed to more books than I was aware off.  Couple of weeks ago  we were having some fun Googling for pictures of collegues when Mario came up with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bookpool.com/sm/1597492175&quot;&gt;Link to a bookcover&lt;/a&gt; that had meta information with my name on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Best Damn Server Virtualization Book Period&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never heard of the book, but it was published by  Syngress with whom last year I worked on the Virtualization with Xen book.  As the cover of the book on Amazon told me that I was involved in the book I set on to find  a PDF of the book which one of the collegues quickly found. And indeed my name was in the book , and also the chapters I had written for the Xen book seemed to be inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I contacted my editor at syngress again to get some more information and hopefully also the book.&lt;br /&gt;
And eventually they got back to me and send me a copy of the book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/images/damnbook.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with 2007 being on of my most busiest years so far I managed to do even more than I knew of .. I didn&#039;t write a significant part of just 1 book but 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whow .. and all of that while I became a father,  started a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inuits.be/&quot;&gt;company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still not sure what to think about it .. &lt;/p&gt;
