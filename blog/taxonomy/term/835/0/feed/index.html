 <title>Fedora 7 Wireless weirdness</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/620</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I first started using my Fonero I had some weird behavior with my Laptop&#039;s wireless card. Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network    I could usually see 2 of my 3 wireless networks but not my MyPlace network.    Sometimes I couldn&#039;t see any wireless network untill after a rmmod iwl3945 modprobe iwl3945 sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere last weekend I was fed up with my slow booting laptop and decided it was time to clean up my bootorder and remove unused services that I had installed for test purposes only from it&#039;s boot procedure.   One of the steps I took was removing the default enabling of my wlan0 interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was pretty astonishing,  not only is my laptop booting much faster, but also whenever I now manually start NetworkManager  it actually finds the MyPlace network and connects to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes I know I should upgrade to FC8 someday , and probably this is a known fact/fix but I  never bothered to look further.  Lazyness you know ;)&lt;/p&gt;
