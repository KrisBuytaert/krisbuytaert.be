 <title>Linux Open Administration Days 2010</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/linux-open-administration-days-2010</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So about 4 monts ago &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bdesmet.be/?p=272&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;there was the crazy idea&lt;/a&gt; to start a new FOSS event in Belgium targeted  at sysadmins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What started out as an event for local people to meet local people with some local speakers actually ended up being a small local event with some top international speakers on onfiguration mananagement and system administration mixed with a bunch of good local ones !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the honour to open the conference with an extremely short version of the Devops talk I gave earlier last year..  extremely short as I knew that over the course of the weekend the topic would reoccur a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had the first european talk on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt;, by Joshua Timberman,  and we had Puppet talks amongst by Dan Bode from Puppetlabs and CFengine talks ,  devops was a frequently dropped word,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a book raffle where we handed out O&#039;Reilly&#039;s .. we had a great free pizza party (got the idea from the saturday pizza event at LCA 2005) ,  and we had some free beer.      Sounds like a good combination for a geeky weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the regular talks there were plenty of Open Spaces where interesting topics were discussed ... we had spaces on Open Source vs Open Core , strong voices were heard when we discussed what we should do with the Open Core companies that claim to value Open Source , some people think we should actually list the fauxpensource ones somewhere and make sure the world knows about them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had an awesome configuration management discussion session  discussing Chef vs Puppet vs CFengine . And much much more ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people owe me plenty of Sushi as I had to do my MySQL HA talk before their Managing MySQL talk  , but other than that .. things just went fine..&lt;/p&gt;
