 <title>Beyond Configuration Mgmt</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/beyond-configuration-mgmt</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;(This post has been sitting in the drafts folder for way to long,  I decided to push the publish button anyhow .. some people might get ideas from it..)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve all run in to the problem,  you&#039;ve puppetized, or euh .. cooked ,  about every part of your infrastructure and then there&#039;s this one service which has no config files,  a broken api that doesn&#039;t allow you to configure antyhing, but a magnificent web gui to configure all aspects of the service.  Magnificent for the eye ,  full of AJAX and other fancy stuff which wget isn&#039;t really keen on.  Off course before it even starts working you need to set it&#039;s password , from that webgui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when you are lucky they store al their config in a database, which you can dump, parse and replace all the host specific parameters for other deployments,   but is that an approach you like ?  As for each new version you&#039;ll need to reanalyze the db layout.  But no matter how you look at it ,dumping the DB and restoring it is an ugly hack you don&#039;t want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other alternatives like sniffing the traffic and replaying the POSTS etc were considered ...   but fancy AJAX stuff and SSL make that less trivial than it seems &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wo while discussing with an upstream project they proposed to actually screenscrape their config webgui .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So screenscraping the config gui it is .. but how ...  I started looking at tools that are typically used for testing rather than for automation, with the purpose of replaying the scenarios one needs to configure the services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first attempt was Selenium,  it plugs into a browser , so it&#039;s easy to acraully record what it has to do,  and it saves it&#039;s scenarios  in a somewhat readable/ editable format.&lt;br /&gt;
Having found the export to perl function it alll looked promising.   However the export to perl isn&#039;t really an export to perl as I epxected .. I assumed it would just generate the perl code to run the same scneario which would be awesome .. it however generates a perl script that instructs a selenium server to run the script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the annoyancies I ran into with Selenium is that a browser&lt;br /&gt;
doesn&#039;t accept self signed certificates , and one can&#039;t preprovision a browser easyily with those freshly created certificates. (Yes Karl I already read about certutil ... )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had heard good things about Cucumber so I was pretty eager to start testing it ...  In short Cucumber  lack documentation ,&lt;br /&gt;
I tried a couple of things but I couldn&#039;t get beyond testing if a certain string was on a page..  couldn&#039;t figure out how to fill in a form etc ...&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe if anyone could point me to some great documentation on how you should write recipe&#039;s here ... I didn&#039;t find the documentation all to  easy to find ..&lt;br /&gt;
Bummer as it really really looks promisiung .. specially since it is so lightweight ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP played with JMeter and Sahi too .. but still&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So apart from filing bugs to the upstream project/product and hoping they understand your problem and are willing to oopen up their API , what other options do you folks suggest ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a short talk about this at Puppetcamp in Amsterdam  and the audience came up with a bunch of other potential projects to look at .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://hpricot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hpricot&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webinject.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;WebInject&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://sikuli.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Project Sikuli&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://watir.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Watir&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem still is that all these are tools to automate testing , they don&#039;t provide you with a general purpose approach to solve the configuration mgmt problem, each time the upstream vendor modifies the layout of his page you hav e to do the work again  and that .. really doesn&#039;t sound promising ..&lt;/p&gt;
