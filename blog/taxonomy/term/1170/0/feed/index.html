 <title>Will Poken  catch on ? </title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/will-poken-catch</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://doyoupoken.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Poken&lt;/a&gt; is the new gadget in town. &lt;a href=&quot;http://streamlinedmind.com/2008/12/03/poken-the-future-of-social-networking/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; people called it the future of social networking.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of exchanging data at the click of a button , or less has been here fore ages.  The problem always is that the tool needs to gain Critical Mass before it becomes useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember transferring my VCard from my Palm Pilot or Handspring Visor to other people&#039;s Palm Pilot , or using different IrDA protocols to transfer my details between different phones,  that worked fine, for the happy few that had similar devices. These days we transfer details over SMS&#039; messages or Bluetooth,  but then they are stuck in the mobile phone,  with the Palm I at least imported them in my PIM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is not everybody had a Palm, not everybody had a IrDa enabled phone , and people tend to turn off Bluetooth for security reasons.     The idea of adding a (soon to be rebranded) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tikitag.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;TikiTag&lt;/a&gt; to your business card seemed cool, So far I could hand out 2 cards to people whom I was absolutely sure they had a reader ,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So different efforts have tried already the same .. to exchange digital data while people had physical contact.   none of them seems to have catched on .. yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Poken is on the way .. maybe this time it will catch on .. who knows .. it surely looks more viral than the others ...&lt;/p&gt;
