  <div class="content"><p>When you eventually will buy Sun ..</p>
<p>Oh nooos.. I started this post last week and now it al seems in vain :(</p>
<p>Steven has some clues on what could have <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/good_bye_solaris_the_fate_of_suns_top_5_technologies">happened</a>,  I think he is right on the spot on with his Solaris prediction ..</p>
<p>He wonders why IBM would spend even another dime on Solaris, actually even today I can't even see why Sun is spending any more money on developing Solaris. But even with no acquisition his prediction of the future of Open Solaris imvho is spot on:</p>
<blockquote><p>
OpenSolaris will likely live on as a purely community-based operating system. After failing to gain any real traction against Linux, I expect it to become like the BSD operating systems: useful in niches and with a strong, core group of developers, but never to become a major operating system power.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As for Sparc,  well I told it before.. and given the Siemens-  Fujitsu split, given that Fujitsu has the money (which is where I have no clue)  and given 2  Sparc companies with completing markets , both geographically as on hardware and software level..  merging Fujitsu and Sun would make sense ...</p>
<p>Looking around me .. I think Netbeans has already been Eclipsed ages ago .. I once used to work with NetBeans, but today I don't know a lot of people who still use it.</p>
<p>As for MySQL,  <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/011046.html">Jeremey</a> has some good insights..  the fact that different prominent MySQL folks  have left Sun will only push the MySQL development model towards more openness.<br />
And towards an even more Redder RedHat alike  model,  we already have the first CentOS alike rebuilds of MySQL , so a distribution model based on the same kernel with different feature sets or focus indeed might be the future.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/if_ibm_sun_breaks_down_what_happens_to_sun">Steven</a> has a nice follow up on what can happen with Sun now.  But the obvious problem  would have been be the culture clash , at least for the MySQL folks..  , I can hardly imagine <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/gameguy/entry/sex_at_ibm_and_sun">al that nice code being written with no Liquor </a>  :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Unless you are doing it wrong.</p>
<p>And sadly I`m seeing more and more people doing it wrong.<br />
To a lot of people Open Source means that they have a piece of software that does almost what they want and which they can modify to their best wishes and use internally.</p>
<p>So they fork locally,, they don't redistribute their code , but they aren't contributing their changes back upstream, chances are these changes wouldn't be accepted upstream anyhow as they are really customizing the code  for their specific cases.   At first sight this doesn't look so bad , at second sight ..</p>
<p>When weeks or months later the upstream project releases an urgent security fix, the local fork has deviated soo much that it can't upgrade anymore and stays with an insecure version.<br />
Often it's worse.. a feature that could have been accepted upstream has been implemented slightly different in the local fork, the result being that newer features depending on the first one also can't be integrated anymore </p>
<p>Some projects are prepared for local contributions, they have a modular framework that allows you to build on top of the project while not having to touch the core of a project,  Drupal and openQRM are great examples of those, but not all projects are that smart. Needless to say that when you have such a modular framework you really shouldn't be modifying the core part of the platform, unless you are fixing a real bug.</p>
<p>But the general rule of thumb is that when you fix bugs,  make sure they are inserted upstream , or implement new features.</p>
<p>Now sometimes there is no easy way to get your code accepted upstream, in which case you should announce clearly that you want to contribute but you are blocked and publish the patches somewhere else ... </p>
<p>Don't let the community work for you, but work with the community !</p>

  <div class="content"><p>If you've been reading this blog for a while you'll know that<br />
for the past decade I've had a love-hate relation ship with Sun.     </p>
<p>Sun has done a lot of good things in their open source journey  such as MySQL, openOffice , Virtualbox  and  opensourcing Java.  But on the other hand they had troubles with creating really organic opensource.  </p>
<p>I've always wondered why a company that bought StarDivision because it was cheaper than buying the MS Office license keeps wasting money on building it's own operating systems, albeit in a pretty open model, but with zero to no relevant community.</p>
<p>Yes I've ranted on their marketing boys and girls when they polluted forums I liked.    But no I don't want <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/perlow/?p=9343" rel="nofollow">this</a> to happen. (Slicing up Sun) </p>
<p>However I`m in fear it actually might happen, the funny thing is that I already mentioned the same idea in offline conversations during the last couple of months.</p>
<p>My Advice to Sun.  : Stop putting money in things you can co-create  with other organisations,  if there's only 2 features in your product that count for some people,   contribute those 2 features to something bigger.<br />
(That's D-Trace and ZFS and the Linux Kernel I`m talking about in case you didn't realise)  Why keep throwing money down the drain ? </p>
<p>Also let Google, Percona and others contribute to MySQL, don't keep it as closed as it is today.  As after al it's more Free software than it is Open Source, but it has a great community which I love to be part of .. and I hope for a long time to come..</p>
<p>I`m going to try to keep my mouth shut on this for a while.. as I think   <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/" rel="nofollow">Jonathan</a> is listening anyhow.   If he was, he would have known that at some point in time when you step out of the shower and there is too much hair dropping from your skull every morning, it's time to cut off the <a>ponytail..</a> , not <a href="http://www.sun.com/ponytail/" rel="nofollow">opensource it</a>.  I did that years ago.. and it's growing much thicker again now. </p>
<p>My hair that is ..</p>

  <div class="content"><p>or timebound ? <strong> or don't you have any load on your DB at all ?</strong></p>
<p>I personally don't see many reasons to virtualize your database,  apart from the , we plan to start small and scale out, or the we need it now and we don't have the hardware yet  , putting your database on a virtual platform where you have to share resources with other virtual machines doesn't really sound like a tempting proposition to me.   Small, almost idle databases , maybe.  But enterprise production level databases no thnx.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pythian.com/blogs/1321/virtualizing-mysql" rel="nofollow">Sheeri Cabral</a> also mentions the above reasons ..  and there also .. Enterprise Production use isn't listed.</p>
<p>Databases typically  require a good amount of memory , and steady disk access.<br />
So if you are in a production environment with a fairly loaded database, would you want a 4Gb machine with full direct memory access,  Or 3.5Gb of virtual memory that can be ballooned to 3 if underused.   My pick is at the 4Gb real memory.</p>
<p>The original article at Sun argues the use of Virtual Harddisk to move around workloads between different servers or even Virtualization platforms.  But it fails to describe the guaranteed performance penalty of not using raw disks but a filesystem on top of a loopback device.  How many layers do you want before actually write to the disks. Good practice in a virtual environment is to dedicate full disks or LVM parts to the virtual machine hence lowering the overhead, but most (default) setups do the opposite.</p>
<p>And don't get me started about <a href="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/node/750">the myth</a> of using virtualization for high-availability :)</p>
<p>Now can somebody please remove all the clueless marketing people from planetmysql.org , thnx.  (they can be identified with by a blogs.sun.com source and posts that  mainly talk about Sun products including only a slight hint to MySQL)</p>
<p>(PS. What's a  Market Development Engineer's  job description anyhow  ? , that's just a different name for Marketing Assistant right ?)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>To save Solaris from a certain death ?</p>
<p>Reading Planet MySQL the last couple of hours I'm trying really hard to convince myselve the Solaris offensive there is not orchestrated.. but I can't.<br />
It might ofcourse be the fresh MySQL users that Sun brought in on their platform that started out blogging but hey .. I`m paranoia right :)</p>
<p>Are they really trying to get at least a fraction of the MySQL community on Solaris.  Do they really think they can ?  Yes they lost a zillion of Solaris customers  that were running a proprietary database to MySQL on Linux users ,, but why would they want to move back to a semi proprietary setup ?</p>
<p>According to Linuxjournal Alan Cox seems to think that ZFS  is the only thing that is keeping Solaris alive.    I don't think DTrace was a bigg mass tool that would convince the crowds to suddenly move to an other operating system.</p>
<p>So is Sun trying to Lock In a community ? <a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/online/news/linux_kongress_linux_foundation_declares_os_x_a_luxury_jail" rel="nofollow">Other people</a> would call it a Jail, altough I wouldn't consider this particular type of jail a Luxury one :)</p>
<p>Why can't Sun just drop the whole idea of building its own OS and contribute more , they are slowly learning in some other  fields , but in the Operating System field they still haven't realised they should up the fight ...  but then again .. I overheard someone say recently   "The best fights to watch, are the ones that can't be won anymore .."</p>
<p>So just remember .. the L in LAMP still stands for Linux,</p>

<p>Bull's Eye .. I loved reading every second of it  as it is so true ...  I told you folks <a href="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/node/613">earlier</a>  that we'd love to help, but it really is time for Sun to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up :)</p>
<p>It's fear it's either  that or down the drain with the other bunch of companies that are on the road to obsoletion.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Over the past couple of days Sun has been getting a lot of feedback on it's behaviour with open source.</p>
<p>So there is <a href="http://www.linux-foundation.org/weblogs/amanda/2008/02/17/hey-jonathan-the-l-in-lamp-is-literal/" rel="nofollow">Amanda McPherson</a> trying to teach Sun that the L in LAMP really stands for Linux.</p>
<p>And then there was <a href="http://mail.opensolaris.org/pipermail/ogb-discuss/2008-February/004488.html" rel="nofollow">Roy T. Fielding</a>  quiting the Open Solaris community.<br />
I'm still wondering why a company that once bought StarDivision because it was cheaper to buy the company than to pay licenses for similar functionality, keeps maintining their own kernel stack rather than contributing to one  that is way more popular and as a much larger userbase.<br />
Its not like they have a die hard community they will loose,  it's not like they will loose customers over it.  When Sun says that Linux is the new Solaris their customers will just follow.</p>
<p>Personally I stopped working with Solaris ages ago... when we ocasionally run into a customer that wants us to deploy things on Solaris we always have to spend extra time GNUifying the box, which is yet another pain.</p>
<p>Sun had to learn the hard way  from the JAVA crowd that they do care about Licensing and a community only starts to build when they like what they see.  and it's exactly that community that Solaris is still lacking.</p>
<p>Virtualbox  also is in the same boat,  they have a good user community, but they don't have a lot of contributers as they require contributors so use the MIT license and even sign some papers.</p>
<p>In a way MySQL used to be the same ,  altough lots changed during the last couple of years , but back a couple of years ago nobody outside of MySQL was contributing code,  there was a gigantic user community, but not really a developer community.</p>
<p>The big difference here is in community.. not customer base, these people are actually using MySQL because they are freely choosing so.  Not because their boss or corporate policy tells them to.<br />
But MySQL learned, and is changing,  it currently has also non employees contributing .. often ex employees  but also other people , people that form a real community.</p>
<p>Today  .. if you really want to cash out  ... create an product open source it ,create a user community around it but don't allow contributors,  my bet is Sun will buy you :)</p>
<p>I told it before.. I really really hope one day Sun will understand .. but from the past couple of acquisitions..  they seem to be taking the same path over and over again.</p>
