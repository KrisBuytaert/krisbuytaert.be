 <title>Oops, Free beer for some .. </title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/oops-free-beer-some</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So yesterday around 2010 a bunch of us arrived at the Kulminator, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To our surprise it was closed :(&lt;br /&gt;
We opted to move to the closest available place , the Zeppos and&lt;br /&gt;
I called pretty much everybody who&#039;s phonenr I had handy that I knew could come.   (much voicemails)  I hope not too much people ended up standing in front of a closed door with no idea where to go (my phonenr is easy to find) but the ones that made it to the new place benefitted from Free Beer sponsored by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inuits.be/&quot;&gt;Inuits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose the Kulminator because it was a well known place and different people had suggested it.  And when Bram commented that the place wouldn&#039;t open till 2000 on mondays I figured it would be open for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big was our surprise when towards the end of the evening he pulled out a card from the Kulminator which indeed mentioned it&#039;s opening hours.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&#039;s not go there in the beginning of august either .. :) &lt;/p&gt;
