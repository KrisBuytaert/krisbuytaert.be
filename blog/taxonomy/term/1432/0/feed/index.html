 <title>Musical Fedora Annoyancies.</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/musical-fedora-annoyancies</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://poke152.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Karl&lt;/a&gt; has been jokingly calling Fedora the Distribution if you don&#039;t want sound.&lt;br /&gt;
And I`m starting to believe him ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 3 days that I&#039;m using Fedora 14 I&#039;ve had random crashes&lt;br /&gt;
Given that all my podcast feeds are configured in my favourite rhytmbox .. that&#039;s what I started out with..  On my F12 setup it used to be pretty stable... however it took me less than 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
for the first crash...  and then another one .. and another one..&lt;br /&gt;
So I started looking at other clients ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a mixed collection of Ogg and MP3&#039;s grabbed from my own cd&#039;s   so there shouldn&#039;t be too much weird stuff  in that collection. On my desktop  there&#039;s only like 4G  of music so parsing the data should not be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered Amarok, installed it .. and the same happened .. after 5-10 minutes it crashed..&lt;br /&gt;
I tought about Banshee... however when seeing the dependencies I quickly aborted the installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People on twitter started suggesting me other tools&lt;br /&gt;
Like clementine which I never heard of ... sadly  I managed to crash clementine within 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After clementine it was time for yet another tool  Vincent  suggested me Exaile .. guess what ... it crashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/images/Screenshot-AutomaticBugReportingTool.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet still...  Fedora doesn&#039;t want me to listen to my music ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So does anyone dare to suggest yet another music player  that I should test for random crashes ?&lt;/p&gt;
