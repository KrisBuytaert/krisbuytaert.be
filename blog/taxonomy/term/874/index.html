  <div class="content"><p>So back in early may 2007 (yes 2007) I signed up for the Xcerion Beta program,  I`m always interested in the next new Internet OS etc so I tought it was a good idea to give it a try.</p>
<p>In December of that same year I got a message stating that I made it to their Beta cloud.  Their mail stated </p>
<p><cite><br />
This is your invitation to participate in Xcerion's XIOS/3 Beta program. You are one of the first in the world to get access to XIOS/3.<br />
We currently only support IE6+ browsers. We are working on adding Firefox support (high priority).<br />
</cite></p>
<p>Obviously  didn't sign up ..<br />
In April when I got the invite mail for the 4th time .. I replied to the Xcerion folks .. </p>
<p><cite><br />
 As I am a Linux user .. I need firefox , since your initial mail<br />
 december 21st last year you say that Firefoxx support is high<br />
 priority ...<br />
</cite></p>
<p>Their reply: </p>
<p><cite><br />
We have made some great progress on the Firefox version. This is the most<br />
complex and fully featured cloud OS available, which makes porting more time<br />
consuming. We are also constantly adding a lot of features. Xcerion is also<br />
considering doing a native Linux version :)</cite></p>
<p>Today I got yet another mail from them guess what still isn't supported ? </p>
<p><cite><br />
We currently support IE6+ browsers. Rest assured that we are working on adding Firefox support (high priority). The Firefox support will also enable usage of icloud on Mac and Linux</cite></p>
<p>It's time to give up guys .. you lost the battle.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Slashdot totally misinterpreted <a href="http://jcole.us/blog/archives/2008/04/14/just-announced-mysql-to-launch-new-features-only-in-mysql-enterprise/" rel="nofollow">Jeremy's</a> post about MySQL starting to build features first for their customers.  As a business model , this sounds like a good way to get revenue , customers want certain features that are valuable to them , so why not let them pay for it .</p>
<p>The question however is how your development cycle works.    Often this method of keeping code first for your paying customers , and when "the feature has been paid for" give it to the opensource community , is the wrong one.  </p>
<p>What it comes down to is that you neglect the release early , release often and the peer review , many eyeballs  see more bugs,  fundamentals that made opensource projects big and stable.   You are in effect stepping back to a proprietary model where you have to rush your deadlines because you have promised customers such and such feature, hence letting your customers do your beta testing.</p>
<p>It’s not like it’s the first time MySQL pulls this trick. They already did that when building a Carrier Grade edition for Cluster. That indeed also was a product where they had customers paying for unstable beta products. </p>
<p>The peer review process is one of the things that insanely attracted me in Open Source,  the code that you get is not some piece of overrushed code  where a  developer made a dozen shortcuts because he had to make a deadline, but a piece of code that has been reviewed by many ,  discussed, and then eventually allowed  into the project. </p>
<p>Releasing beta level code to customers and eventually to opensource means you miss out on a lot of the features a true opensource project has.</p>
<p>Often the reason why Open source minded organisations still chose for this approach is to get revenue to be able to hire more developers/ support peope and improve the product faster.  But it's a vicious circle, because your product isn't up to the standards you are used to you need more people to support it.  </p>
<p>However in the MySQL case , a mostly user community, lesser user development contributions, this could make sense.</p>
