 <title>Xcerion,  please abort your mission </title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/672</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So back in early may 2007 (yes 2007) I signed up for the Xcerion Beta program,  I`m always interested in the next new Internet OS etc so I tought it was a good idea to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December of that same year I got a message stating that I made it to their Beta cloud.  Their mail stated &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is your invitation to participate in Xcerion&#039;s XIOS/3 Beta program. You are one of the first in the world to get access to XIOS/3.&lt;br /&gt;
We currently only support IE6+ browsers. We are working on adding Firefox support (high priority).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously  didn&#039;t sign up ..&lt;br /&gt;
In April when I got the invite mail for the 4th time .. I replied to the Xcerion folks .. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 As I am a Linux user .. I need firefox , since your initial mail&lt;br /&gt;
 december 21st last year you say that Firefoxx support is high&lt;br /&gt;
 priority ...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their reply: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have made some great progress on the Firefox version. This is the most&lt;br /&gt;
complex and fully featured cloud OS available, which makes porting more time&lt;br /&gt;
consuming. We are also constantly adding a lot of features. Xcerion is also&lt;br /&gt;
considering doing a native Linux version :)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I got yet another mail from them guess what still isn&#039;t supported ? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We currently support IE6+ browsers. Rest assured that we are working on adding Firefox support (high priority). The Firefox support will also enable usage of icloud on Mac and Linux&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s time to give up guys .. you lost the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Let your betatesters pay !</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/644</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Slashdot totally misinterpreted &lt;a href=&quot;http://jcole.us/blog/archives/2008/04/14/just-announced-mysql-to-launch-new-features-only-in-mysql-enterprise/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jeremy&#039;s&lt;/a&gt; post about MySQL starting to build features first for their customers.  As a business model , this sounds like a good way to get revenue , customers want certain features that are valuable to them , so why not let them pay for it .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question however is how your development cycle works.    Often this method of keeping code first for your paying customers , and when &quot;the feature has been paid for&quot; give it to the opensource community , is the wrong one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it comes down to is that you neglect the release early , release often and the peer review , many eyeballs  see more bugs,  fundamentals that made opensource projects big and stable.   You are in effect stepping back to a proprietary model where you have to rush your deadlines because you have promised customers such and such feature, hence letting your customers do your beta testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not like it’s the first time MySQL pulls this trick. They already did that when building a Carrier Grade edition for Cluster. That indeed also was a product where they had customers paying for unstable beta products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peer review process is one of the things that insanely attracted me in Open Source,  the code that you get is not some piece of overrushed code  where a  developer made a dozen shortcuts because he had to make a deadline, but a piece of code that has been reviewed by many ,  discussed, and then eventually allowed  into the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Releasing beta level code to customers and eventually to opensource means you miss out on a lot of the features a true opensource project has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often the reason why Open source minded organisations still chose for this approach is to get revenue to be able to hire more developers/ support peope and improve the product faster.  But it&#039;s a vicious circle, because your product isn&#039;t up to the standards you are used to you need more people to support it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However in the MySQL case , a mostly user community, lesser user development contributions, this could make sense.&lt;/p&gt;
