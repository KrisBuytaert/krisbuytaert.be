 <title>A parallel universe</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/parallel-universe</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;What happens when you mention &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph6ZeEDnFmc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Open Office and Firewall&lt;/a&gt; in once sentence, in public  ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People start actually building &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wzdftpd.net/blog/index.php?2010/06/16/46-le-pare-feu-openoffice&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;  (French Article) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then add to that list that there&#039;s also people out there that think that running MySQL over NFS is providing them High Availability,    or that using DNS Round Robin will provide them a scalable setup,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yes .. apparently there is indeed a parallel universe out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no .. I don&#039;t want to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/KrisBuytaert/building-appliances&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Webmin&lt;/a&gt;   in any Appliance .. that is a joke..., or rather a rant ..&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dear Oracle,</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/dear-oracle</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I wrote a post titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/dear-ibm&quot;&gt;Dear IBM&lt;/a&gt; ,  I was too late ..   I was on holliday last week when people started sending me text messages ,   such as .. &quot;Game Over MySQL , Long live Ingress&quot; or &quot;No Eclipse for IBM&quot;,  etc ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had ideas  regarding the future of certain  Sun products at IBM,  now the game has changed .. it&#039;ss how they will live on at Oracle :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar Questions arise .. like indeed the future of MySQL,  the future of Solaris etc ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So regarding the future of MySQL ,  I don&#039;t worry at all, on the contrary ..&lt;br /&gt;
Oracle tried buying mysql before they already have Innodb .. they didn&#039;t kill it ..  the MySQL offering is complementary to the Oracle offering,  now they can tackle both markets.&lt;br /&gt;
And as already mentionned  when writing my IBM letter ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As for MySQL, Jeremey has some good insights.. the fact that different prominent MySQL folks have left Sun will only push the MySQL development model towards more openness.&lt;br /&gt;
And towards an even more Redder RedHat alike model, we already have the first CentOS alike rebuilds of MySQL , so a distribution model based on the same kernel with different feature sets or focus indeed might be the future.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further there&#039;s what &lt;a href=&quot;http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2009/04/to-be-free-or-not-to-be-free.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Monty Said ... &lt;/a&gt; hang on ... nobody mentions the fact that some core PostgreSQL people are on Sun&#039;s payroll  how&#039;s that going to turn out ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more interresting discussion is the future of Solaris one..  Oracle has always had an eye for Solaris.. one day it is their most important platform, the other day they tell the world Linux is their prime development platform,  it often was a matter of who was quoted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Unbreakable Oracle did a smart thing.. they learned that they should build a full operating system themselves but ,  so why should they want to do that with Solaris ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinuxWorld has an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2009/042009-opensolaris-linux-could-merge-under.html?page=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; where oracle states their idea about Linux :&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
What we are working to do in the data center ... is to make Linux the default for the data center OS,&quot; Screven said in a speech at the Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit in San Francisco. &quot;We want there to be no question&quot;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They suggest a merger between Solaris and Linux is a potential alternative ..  so what do we need to merge .. you&#039;d say ZFS and DTrace ..,but do we really need ZFS ?&lt;br /&gt;
There  has been a lot of writing already about BTRFS being the next big filesystem,  maybe it could make ZFS obsolete, maybe it couldn&#039;t ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got no clue on what&#039;s going to happen with OO.org .. so I`m really going to keep an eye on that one ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion the real loser in this deal .. HP .. they don&#039;t have a full stack to play with ..  They have the hardware, some management and monitoring software soon to be obsolete  but no Operating System, no Database, no Appserver, no Apps.  So what&#039;s their next move going to be ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you really want to talk figures &lt;a href=&quot;http://lmaugustin.typepad.com/lma/2009/04/oracle-buys-java-and-mysql-for-free.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Larry Augustin&lt;/a&gt; has a good take on it ...  the idea that Oracle could sell off some parts to Hitachi EMC etc, get MySQL and Sun for Free ...  then quietly wait for RedHat .. to get Jboss  who knows :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS.  I already blogged about the impact of the acquistion on the Virtualization area over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://virtualization.com/acquisitions-acquisition-takeover/2009/04/30/oracle-gets-sun-xvm-solaris-zones-and-virtualbox/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Virtualization.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>T-Dose 2007 is over</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/471</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.t-dose.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;T-Dose&lt;/a&gt;  I was looking forward to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://willy.boerland.com/myblog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bert&#039;s&lt;/a&gt; drupal talk but I was way to late in Eindhoven , just in time to see his last 5 slides   Too bad I couldn&#039;t find him anymore after his talk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after his talk I ran into &lt;a href=&quot;http://mattinaction.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Matt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://tarrysingh.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tarry&lt;/a&gt; ,  Matt is always present at conferences , often giving good talks on stuff I care about such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://openqrm.sf.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;openQRM&lt;/a&gt; this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was great to finally meet Tarry in the physical world, and not just the virtual one, so the Irish Pub meetup in the late afternoon really should be repeated !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Woman without a blog told me about her involvement in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opendocsociety.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OpenDocsSociety&lt;/a&gt; and the 2 upcoming launche parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived way to late at the social event because of the Eindhoven Marathon parking issues we about to have if we didn&#039;t move Matt&#039;s car , but that way I ended up a a table with the guy from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gravityzoo.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Gravity Zoo&lt;/a&gt;, great stuff those guys are working on .. Looking forward to see some of their demos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Irish pub threw us out at 0200 , which was kinda Early.. but the result was that I made it only 5 minutes late for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://zecke.blogspot.com/2007/10/openembedded-at-t-dose.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Open Embedded talk.&lt;/a&gt;  Now I really really want to start looking closer at OpenEmbedded as I feel it would be a really good solution for lots of the stuff different people  are doing wrong , but then I need to get some time slices from an altnerate Universe .. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As promised in Cambridge I went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://dag.wieers.com/blog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dag&#039;s &lt;/a&gt; talk on Dstat as I ran out of it in Cambridge coz of some urgent phonecalls.&lt;br /&gt;
As I already have a private presentation about &lt;a href=&quot;http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/mrepo/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;mrepo&lt;/a&gt; , I can now safely skip his next presentations :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to run out earlier and drop off Matt at his car in the middle of nowhere before heading home.  But T-Dose is growing at good rate.  It&#039;s not yet big and overcrowded as Fosdem so at least you can talk with lots of people !&lt;/p&gt;
