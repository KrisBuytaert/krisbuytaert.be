 <title>Free Beer</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/free-beer</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s a fact .. I suck at handing out  Free beer,  last december we managed to meet in a pub that was closed , and yesterday at the&lt;br /&gt;
 Fosdem beer event when Philip asked me to hand out some plates of beer  I managed getting them out then started wondering why peo&lt;br /&gt;
ple didn&#039;t grab them till I started shouting FREE BEER ... that worked .. .. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual the Beer event was lots of fun bumping into people you iknow but whose name you need to think about for over a minute beo&lt;br /&gt;
fre you can remember it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway .. In case you didn&#039;t realize yet it&#039;s  Fosdem time&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Oops, Free beer for some .. </title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/oops-free-beer-some</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So yesterday around 2010 a bunch of us arrived at the Kulminator, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To our surprise it was closed :(&lt;br /&gt;
We opted to move to the closest available place , the Zeppos and&lt;br /&gt;
I called pretty much everybody who&#039;s phonenr I had handy that I knew could come.   (much voicemails)  I hope not too much people ended up standing in front of a closed door with no idea where to go (my phonenr is easy to find) but the ones that made it to the new place benefitted from Free Beer sponsored by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inuits.be/&quot;&gt;Inuits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose the Kulminator because it was a well known place and different people had suggested it.  And when Bram commented that the place wouldn&#039;t open till 2000 on mondays I figured it would be open for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big was our surprise when towards the end of the evening he pulled out a card from the Kulminator which indeed mentioned it&#039;s opening hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/pics/KulMinator.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&#039;s not go there in the beginning of august either .. :) &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Free Beer, planet.grep.be Meetup</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/free-beer-planetgrepbe-meetup</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://planet.grep.be/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;planet.grep.be&lt;/a&gt; today has a lot of active open source users and contributors.&lt;br /&gt;
The weird thing is that we never meet apart from Fosdem.&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, we occasionally run into eachother at other events but there&#039;s not enough beer involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve had different people ask me  what and where are the Open Source gatherings in Belgium,   and we must admit that apart&lt;br /&gt;
from Fosdem there isn&#039;t that much in our little country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of MySQL User Group events, some Drupal ones, some LUG had meetings altough I have the idea most of them have dried out :(  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have this crazy idea of  inviting you all to grab a beer, maybe even  free beer :) on december 29 some in a pub in Antwerp &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I`m open for suggestions on good locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and everybody is welcome, both readers and writers :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS.  Yes I know that some of you will be drinking in Berlin at that time .. we&#039;ll drink an extra one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>OpenExpo Social event </title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/732</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday apart from Free Beer, the social event also featured a couple of 5 minute lightning talks.&lt;br /&gt;
Tobias Oetiker took the first slot, his 5 minute talk was incredible.  In 5 minutes he went trough 80 something slides , really remined me of the St Peter talk about Jabber and Security a couple of years ago at Fosdem.  I after 2 talks I realised that I could strip down my OLS openQRM talk and give it in 5 minutes too .. so I did :)   Awesome.. 5 minutes is really really really short :)&lt;br /&gt;
But I managed .. I even got questions at the end :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely a good concept to let people decide on giving a talk at such a short notice :)&lt;/p&gt;
