 <title>EEEbuntu</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/705</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s gone,  the Xandros that is..  I moved to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eeebuntu.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;EEEBuntu&lt;/a&gt;, the NBR 1.0 release.&lt;br /&gt;
Installed like a charm ..  iso2stick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty funny header  :)&lt;br /&gt;
# Convert an Ubuntu live CD iso so that it&#039;s bootable off of a USB stick&lt;br /&gt;
# Copyright 2007  Red Hat, Inc.&lt;br /&gt;
# Jeremy Katz&lt;br /&gt;
# Jani Monoses  (slightly adapted to Ubuntu LiveCD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tried it first .. the live distro luxury ... and the thing that made me decide was the better font support, much more screen realestate with Eeebuntu , that and the fact that much more tools that can be installed by default from a public repository while not breaking the dependency chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a backup of my configs.. well.. home dir  then live-install and off we went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything works like a charm, just like with the original Xandors distro,&lt;br /&gt;
suspend resume works,  wifi works, my whole box is back up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next goal, upgrade my laptop :)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A week of EEE</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/703</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Obviously this last OLS week I&#039;ve been carrying around my EEE.  I left my big fat laptop in the hotel room to work on and make backups&lt;br /&gt;
 at night but the main working machine of the week was my EEE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typing speed etc was reasonable the I only often ran into hitting the Up arror rather than the Shift button.&lt;br /&gt;
My biggest dissappointment however is the battery life.  Surfing on this thing for more than 2 hours is just not feasable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it&#039;s a matter of getting it charged again ...  watching /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state  update while you are still using it is as&lt;br /&gt;
 painfull as watching grass grow. and shrink again while you watch at it .. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I tried to keep it charging as much as possible.. so that I could  make it to the end of the day.  Then charge it at night so I could had a full battery again by the next morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But afterall the EEE cost less than my phone.. so it&#039;s worth the money .. and I was really glad to have it with  me it&#039;s small, it&#039;s&lt;br /&gt;
lightweight .. and will last more conferences for me :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O that and the fact that it heats up a lot&lt;/p&gt;
