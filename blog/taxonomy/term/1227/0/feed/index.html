 <title>Dear IBM</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/dear-ibm</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When you eventually will buy Sun ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh nooos.. I started this post last week and now it al seems in vain :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven has some clues on what could have &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.computerworld.com/good_bye_solaris_the_fate_of_suns_top_5_technologies&quot;&gt;happened&lt;/a&gt;,  I think he is right on the spot on with his Solaris prediction ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wonders why IBM would spend even another dime on Solaris, actually even today I can&#039;t even see why Sun is spending any more money on developing Solaris. But even with no acquisition his prediction of the future of Open Solaris imvho is spot on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
OpenSolaris will likely live on as a purely community-based operating system. After failing to gain any real traction against Linux, I expect it to become like the BSD operating systems: useful in niches and with a strong, core group of developers, but never to become a major operating system power.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Sparc,  well I told it before.. and given the Siemens-  Fujitsu split, given that Fujitsu has the money (which is where I have no clue)  and given 2  Sparc companies with completing markets , both geographically as on hardware and software level..  merging Fujitsu and Sun would make sense ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking around me .. I think Netbeans has already been Eclipsed ages ago .. I once used to work with NetBeans, but today I don&#039;t know a lot of people who still use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for MySQL,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/011046.html&quot;&gt;Jeremey&lt;/a&gt; has some good insights..  the fact that different prominent MySQL folks  have left Sun will only push the MySQL development model towards more openness.&lt;br /&gt;
And towards an even more Redder RedHat alike  model,  we already have the first CentOS alike rebuilds of MySQL , so a distribution model based on the same kernel with different feature sets or focus indeed might be the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.computerworld.com/if_ibm_sun_breaks_down_what_happens_to_sun&quot;&gt;Steven&lt;/a&gt; has a nice follow up on what can happen with Sun now.  But the obvious problem  would have been be the culture clash , at least for the MySQL folks..  , I can hardly imagine &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.sun.com/gameguy/entry/sex_at_ibm_and_sun&quot;&gt;al that nice code being written with no Liquor &lt;/a&gt;  :)&lt;/p&gt;
