 <title>Le Tablet nouveau est arrivee</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/le-tablet-nouveau-est-arrivee</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I bought myselve a new gadget,  a tablet.    I wanted  a couple of things, first of all I love the mythdroid app  as a remote control for my MythTV,  but as it runs on my phone and  kids don&#039;t have a phone it was pretty much a blocking issue when I wasn&#039;t at home.&lt;br /&gt;
The second thing I wanted was a device for the kids to play small games on ...   and I also want to use it for the kids to watch some movies while we travel.  On top of that  it would be handy if I could use it to surf the web from my couch while not having to open up my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking into buying an Achos 10.1 which was due to be released earlier this month  but I was fed up with waiting so I went googling for an alternative , and I found one .. it&#039;s an Apad, or an e-pad .. I still don&#039;t know ..  the box says epad&lt;br /&gt;
ebay listed it as a 10.2&quot; Android 2.1 Epad Apad 1GHZ Tablet PC UMPC Netbook   It&#039;s not an iPad, .. it&#039;s chinese and it costs 1/3 of an iPad  and it runs Android.  Yes that&#039;s right .. I had it delivered from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://a-pads.co.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; within 2 working days for just about 200 Euro including shipping.&lt;br /&gt;
Ordered on thursday afternoon .. on my desk before 10AM on monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening the box was  a bit scary .. it had a weird e logo on the side wich some people recognised as a kind of browser logo that I`m unfamiliar with  and the acommpanying manual was only mentioning an platform I don&#039;t want to use ,  however booting up the device reassured me .. there was a nice penguin on the bootup screen and seconds later  an android logo appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Good:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device is really easy to work with , kids can use it .. (that was the goal wasn&#039;t it ? )  It has a USB slot where you can plug in external storage&lt;br /&gt;
and it has a SD slot for similar use .. it came with a 512Mb SD card which I replaced with an 8Gb one .  It has an ethernet connection an extention cable with a real RJ45 connection .  Lots of apps are available from it&#039;s market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s not your default Google Market,  the device has no access to the Google App Market but uses SlideMarket,  not all apps are availble for download that way, however nothing blocks you from downloading .apk files and installing them on the device.   For now I just swapped the SD card from my phone to get all the apps I wanted in a quick way but  I should actually test plugging in my  Android Phone using the USB and install the applications from the backup  as the phone does have access to to the Google Market  (Update:  this actually works)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all apps are using the full screen estate, they&#039;ve been written with 3-4 inch phone screens in mind and not with a 10&quot; tablet in mind.    I&#039;ve heard the same rants about using iPhone apps on the iPad.  The fontsize of the device is configurable but not all text adapts to the new font size  and it also looks like the wifi chipset isn&#039;t the best around..  I often have to reconnect to my wifi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ugly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battery life  is really not good enough .. it should last  3-4 hours but it didn&#039;t even last  2 hours when I first used it .. however  I was busy installing new apps and testing lots of stuff   so in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#039;t figured out how to configure gmail, gtail and other google services yet  I should probably debug what&#039;s going on one day to see if it&#039;s actually a connectivity issue or if big G just blocks access from the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I consider it a 1 on 1 replacement for an iPad ? Probably not ...   it&#039;s not as stylish as the fruit device but looking at the features I wanted compared to the price I paid for it , it&#039;s the perfect gadget ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I want to work  I`ll open my laptop,  when travelling I`ll be using my  EEE , but to play with the kids and lookup stuff from the couch while watching TV it&#039;s going to be a 10&quot; tablet.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>HTC Hero Upgrade</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/htc-hero-upgrade</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This morning my HTC Hero told me it had an upgrade available.&lt;br /&gt;
It wasn&#039;t really the moment to do the upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when tonight I wanted to perform the upgrade I couldn&#039;t really find out how to initiate it again .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently the trick is to put the date of your phone one month forward and you get the update request again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my phone has been updated ... so let&#039;s hope this indeed was the preparation for a real upgrade .. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and don&#039;t forget to put it back to the original date :)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Dear @SonyEricssonBE</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/dear-sonyericssonbe</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I`m very sad,  I won&#039;t be able to make it to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/androidpartybe/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@AndroidPartybe&lt;/a&gt; tonight, and neither will I be making it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/plugg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@plugg&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to sit back and watch you hand out Xperia X10&#039;s to people that plan on selling it to buy a new iPad or a Nexus,  people that don&#039;t realize what a great piece of technolgy Sony Ericsson usually delivers or just kids that want any cool phone and  all that while being forced to use an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/life-android&quot;&gt;HTC Hero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve seen Nokia hand out N900&#039;s to a zillion people , but I don&#039;t want an N900. I&#039;ve been using SonyEricsson devices  for ages  GA628, SH888,  T39m, K700, K800i.I&#039;ve had them all . but as the X10 wasn&#039;t available when my K800i broke down late last year I just couldn&#039;t wait for it anymore and had to get me an Android one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about you giving me  one ? :)&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inuits.be/&quot;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; have a Zimbra, and a Funambol and I have an Android, so what would you think I want to test .. exactly .. run the Android Funambol client on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://android-client.forge.funambol.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;On forge.funambol.org&lt;/a&gt; it looks great ..  nice screenshot .. then you look closer ..&lt;br /&gt;
Contacts OK, Calendar Not supported (yet) .. apparently it has been like that sincs it got released  which is over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I`m looking for  other ideas on how to sync my Zimbra Calendar  with my Android&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Life with an Android</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/life-android</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve have never been a really an HTC fan, because of the platform they used before, I have been a Ericsson GA628, SH888, then Sony Ericsson fanboy for all my life  T39m, K700, K800i , so this is my first attempt into using a different brand of phone , I&#039;ve been wanting an Open Phone for ages.. but I&#039;ve been waiting for Godot, er the openMoko, for way to long now so with the introduction of the HTC and my K800i being long overdue for a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Good,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in gereral I`m pretty satisfied with my HTC Hero so far,  it&#039;s quick/reactive , the wifi has good reception ,  screen quality is good,  the touch screen however will take some time to get used to .. it already happened a couple of times that I accidently started calling the wrong person while I was still browing trough the addressbook.   But in short .. I like the phone ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However there&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://laforge.gnumonks.org/weblog/2009/11/04/#20091104-android_mythbusters&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;lots&lt;/a&gt; of people out there warning us that the Android isn&#039;t really an Open phone, true,  lots of the software on it is proprietary, and lots of the software in the Market is cripple or pay ware.  However imvho it&#039;s a step in the good direction going from a fully closed phone   so something already more open...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume button is to easy to use when in your pocket , hence putting the phone on silent by walking around is not unusable  and  Camera Autofocus is pretty bad .. no I&#039;m not comparing to my EOS 400D, but to my previos Ericsson phone.  the quality of the pictures is shaky  and there is no way to cover the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the The Ugly I&#039;d have to say Bluetooth support,   hey I want to be able to browse / download my addressbook from my Phone to my Bluetooth enabled car  , this is a feature I had on my previous phone, and the phone before that ..I want to be able to upload and download files over Bluetooth, works on both my previous phones , I want to be able to send phonebook entries over bluetooth .. so that&#039;s pretty much my biggest annoyancy&lt;br /&gt;
(unless someone knows solutions for this ?) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when will Sony Ericsson release their Android in Europe ?  I`m hoping they&#039;d keep the features they already had on their previous phones , so I`m hoping for better camera and better bluetooth support ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have come a long way for Linux to be present in our daily life , even for Joe Average,  at home we watch TV using MythTV, my alarm is a Chumby, the phone in my downstairs office is a TuxScreen ...  So I`m wondering when I finally will get a car that is running Linux,&lt;/p&gt;
