 <title>Evolution Happens!</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/553</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in 1998 one of the reasons my boss back then used for not doing something on a Linux box was&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;We don&#039;t have enough people with the skills to support that&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 10 years and the opposite is happening,&lt;br /&gt;
I had a chat with a coworker the other day and we were wondering how we ended up having a windows box from a 3rd party vendor in our platform since no one in our organization knows how to support it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine similar conversations in MySQL environments where people wonder who is going to support that one proprietary database that came a long with an oldskool vendor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution and Adoption is happening, change happens !!&lt;/p&gt;
