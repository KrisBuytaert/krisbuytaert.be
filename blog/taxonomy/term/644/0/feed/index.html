 <title>Going Proprietary again</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/512</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So while shopping for a new Timesheet application, last month we tried to use eHour.   We tried, and have already stopped our evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our requirements are pretty simple.   A bunch of consultants need to be able to book their time on different projects.  We need to be able to print out these timesheets for a customer to be able to sign and our financial department needs to be able to print invoices based on the time we spend for the different customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from a rather itchy user interface,   a really non straightforward way to add projects or even try to modify them it were mainly&lt;br /&gt;
little annoyancies such as not being able to print a timesheet if you only have 1 project you worked on that month, made us look again for alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we ran into &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ehour.nl/index.php/archives/35&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; posting on the eHour blog.   eHour indeed had fixed some of the annoyancies we had but decided to close their source again.      Right end of story for us there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rather than being able to help out and contribute to a better product, we are now once again in the market to try our next Open Source timesheet app.&lt;/p&gt;
