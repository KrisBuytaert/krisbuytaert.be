 <description>&lt;p&gt;And while &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.elisehuard.be/?p=198&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Elise&lt;/a&gt; points us to that quote again.. does anyone remember from which Coupland book I actually got it ?&lt;br /&gt;
I`m guessing Microslaven but I`m really not sure anymore .. could be Generation X also .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deep motivations are exactly the reason why we could be in marketing, only we&#039;d probably&lt;br /&gt;
really have to believe in a product to market it.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Yes I want to the world to stop paying a zillion times for the same piece of code, so I want them to use Free software,
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Yes  I want the computer to do what I say , I want to see why my harddisk is making a noise and I want to be able to kill -9 a process so I use a unix type of sotware.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; I want to be able to read the code and learn from it
&lt;p&gt;And I want others to do so too.. I want them to realize it is possible... so I`m spreading the word, one person at a time I`m explaining them why they might want to give Free Software a try.   I`m blogging about it.. I`m giving talks on different subsets of the topic around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I`m doing marketing for a product I care about , one that I believe in ...  only it happens to be geeky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the lack of internet , computers in general  could there have been another product that I&#039;d be caring about, promoting  and talking about ...  we&#039;ll never know..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;</description>
