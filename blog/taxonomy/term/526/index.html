  <div class="content"><p>I spent way too much time this weekend trying to get the <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/file/includes/pager.inc/5" rel="nofollow">pager</a> stuff in Drupal working for a module I`m playing with.  </p>
<p>I had learned a lot from the watchdog module on how paging was supposed to be working and I was trying to do the same with another database.    As I got a page limited by the number of records I wanted but I couldn't find any of the fancy next, previous and page number thingies that I wanted.    </p>
<p>The watchdog module worked for me and I started stripping the watchdog module till I could actually replace my function with watchdog_overview function.    Even replaced the watchdog query with my qeury..  but not such luck.. I couldn't get   $output .= <span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text">theme('pager', NULL, 50, 0);</code></span>  to work.</p>
<p>So as every open source geek does.. I started looking into the code.  pager.inc<br />
The header told me  the author.. I could mail him and wait or even call him , , but I read on.<br />
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text">$pager_total_items[$element] = db_result(db_query($count_query, $args));</code></span><br />
Never returned  anything useful.., my mysql log learned me there never was any query with a count ..<br />
Till I modified the pager.inc file to actually perform the query I wanted it to do.. and it started working.<br />
Then I took a closer look at the regexp that was being used to create the $count_qeury<br />
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text">$count_query = preg_replace(array('/SELECT.*?FROM /As', '/ORDER BY .*/'), array('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ', ''),$query);</code></span><br />
However my query was all in lowercase so the count was never inserted.</p>
<p>The only difference between the working watchdog module and my own code was in the use of uppercase SQL statements.<br />
So call me lazy :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Every once in a while you start with something new..   you're used to being rather expercienced on different topics in open source , having written an article and a book left or right  but there comes a day when you will feel a total newbie again :)</p>
<p>About 10 years ago I was mostly into technical webdevelopment , perl, php, oracle plsql , java servlets  , coldfusion stuff like that.. I stopped building corporate websites about 7-8 years ago when I realised I was spending more time helping people to build the infrastructure to host those sites than actually building the sites. (That and the fact that I really got bored with people wanting greener green)</p>
<p>So fast forward to about 5-6 months ago where I suddenly felth the need again to start writing code for a small pet project of mine.</p>
<p>I wanted a framework where I could jumpstart with different features I needed such as usermanagement  and a blog feature.</p>
<p>As I mentionned earlier this week .. everybody seems to be using Drupal these days and has similar  newbie feelings :)</p>
<p><a href="http://dag.wieers.com/blog/content/mistakes-made-when-using-drupal-personal-blog" rel="nofollow">Dag </a> is posting about his experiences on how to use Drupal as a personal blog.     So my current project is different.</p>
<p>For a personal blog I wouldn't be using the blog module either has he describes, but as I wanted different authors .. I understood I do need it.</p>
<p>I had the same problem with the Vocabularies and Terms .. Upon starting I really didn't understand what they meant for my blog.  So I recreated the categories I had in dotclear in there.    I deleted them from my database after a month, when I figured out how to use tagging in the blog :)</p>
<p>So what do you need when you want to go one step further, like getting content from a database.  So here is where the I probably went totally wrong and where the documentation could use a hand.</p>
<p>I started out writing my own module where I use some drupal functions and custom php code.  Turns out there is something like CCK but I`m still not sure if CCK is the thing I need (or how to use it)</p>
<p>I`m pretty sure the way I`m writing my modules totally wrong also.<br />
I'm having 1 big file in which I do everything.. Pretty crappy if you ask me but I don't really find another way .. Or should I create multiple modules ?</p>
<p>Luckily this is <cite>just a hobby, won't be big and professional like</cite>...  It's just a project to  learn and I got a different dayjob ..<br />
However my fear is that other people probably won't realize how wrong the<br />
are using a certain technology and will offer their services to customers :(</p>
<p>So I`m nagging some people about a new Drupal User group meeting.<br />
Guess Dag and I will learn some stuff there ;)</p>
