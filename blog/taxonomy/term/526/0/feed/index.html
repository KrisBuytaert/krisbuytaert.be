 <title>SELECT vs select</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/522</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent way too much time this weekend trying to get the &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.drupal.org/api/file/includes/pager.inc/5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;pager&lt;/a&gt; stuff in Drupal working for a module I`m playing with.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had learned a lot from the watchdog module on how paging was supposed to be working and I was trying to do the same with another database.    As I got a page limited by the number of records I wanted but I couldn&#039;t find any of the fancy next, previous and page number thingies that I wanted.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The watchdog module worked for me and I started stripping the watchdog module till I could actually replace my function with watchdog_overview function.    Even replaced the watchdog query with my qeury..  but not such luck.. I couldn&#039;t get   $output .= &lt;span class=&quot;geshifilter&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text geshifilter-text&quot;&gt;theme(&#039;pager&#039;, NULL, 50, 0);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as every open source geek does.. I started looking into the code.  pager.inc&lt;br /&gt;
The header told me  the author.. I could mail him and wait or even call him , , but I read on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;geshifilter&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text geshifilter-text&quot;&gt;$pager_total_items[$element] = db_result(db_query($count_query, $args));&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Never returned  anything useful.., my mysql log learned me there never was any query with a count ..&lt;br /&gt;
Till I modified the pager.inc file to actually perform the query I wanted it to do.. and it started working.&lt;br /&gt;
Then I took a closer look at the regexp that was being used to create the $count_qeury&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;geshifilter&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;text geshifilter-text&quot;&gt;$count_query = preg_replace(array(&#039;/SELECT.*?FROM /As&#039;, &#039;/ORDER BY .*/&#039;), array(&#039;SELECT COUNT(*) FROM &#039;, &#039;&#039;),$query);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However my query was all in lowercase so the count was never inserted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only difference between the working watchdog module and my own code was in the use of uppercase SQL statements.&lt;br /&gt;
So call me lazy :)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Newbie Drupal Experiences</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/463</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while you start with something new..   you&#039;re used to being rather expercienced on different topics in open source , having written an article and a book left or right  but there comes a day when you will feel a total newbie again :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 10 years ago I was mostly into technical webdevelopment , perl, php, oracle plsql , java servlets  , coldfusion stuff like that.. I stopped building corporate websites about 7-8 years ago when I realised I was spending more time helping people to build the infrastructure to host those sites than actually building the sites. (That and the fact that I really got bored with people wanting greener green)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So fast forward to about 5-6 months ago where I suddenly felth the need again to start writing code for a small pet project of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted a framework where I could jumpstart with different features I needed such as usermanagement  and a blog feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentionned earlier this week .. everybody seems to be using Drupal these days and has similar  newbie feelings :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dag.wieers.com/blog/content/mistakes-made-when-using-drupal-personal-blog&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dag &lt;/a&gt; is posting about his experiences on how to use Drupal as a personal blog.     So my current project is different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a personal blog I wouldn&#039;t be using the blog module either has he describes, but as I wanted different authors .. I understood I do need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the same problem with the Vocabularies and Terms .. Upon starting I really didn&#039;t understand what they meant for my blog.  So I recreated the categories I had in dotclear in there.    I deleted them from my database after a month, when I figured out how to use tagging in the blog :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you need when you want to go one step further, like getting content from a database.  So here is where the I probably went totally wrong and where the documentation could use a hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out writing my own module where I use some drupal functions and custom php code.  Turns out there is something like CCK but I`m still not sure if CCK is the thing I need (or how to use it)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I`m pretty sure the way I`m writing my modules totally wrong also.&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m having 1 big file in which I do everything.. Pretty crappy if you ask me but I don&#039;t really find another way .. Or should I create multiple modules ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily this is &lt;cite&gt;just a hobby, won&#039;t be big and professional like&lt;/cite&gt;...  It&#039;s just a project to  learn and I got a different dayjob ..&lt;br /&gt;
However my fear is that other people probably won&#039;t realize how wrong the&lt;br /&gt;
are using a certain technology and will offer their services to customers :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I`m nagging some people about a new Drupal User group meeting.&lt;br /&gt;
Guess Dag and I will learn some stuff there ;)&lt;/p&gt;
