 <title>Barcamp Gent 3</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/barcamp-gent-3</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Barcamp Gent 3, the one that took place yesterday is probably going to be my last Barcamp in Belgium.    I already had my doubts upfront when looking at the suggested talks, but once there I realized it was much worse than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lemme repoint you folks to what I wrote about the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/node/195&quot;&gt;Barcamp&lt;/a&gt; in Belgium back in 2006&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe my expectations on what kind of people / talks to meet and see there were a bit wrong.. when looking at other barcamps where people such as whurley and Moshe were present, I was maybe hoping for a bit more of system level innovation etc. or at least more technology innovation rather than Bloggers meet and talk about Blogging tools. I wasn&#039;t sure on what I should talk about as most of the topics I usually speak about would have been so out of scope and probably wouldn&#039;t have reached any potientiel audience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for 3+ years I kept hoping for change,  there&#039;s always an amount of interesting people that show up that make the day interesting, but yesterday there were timeslots with no relevant topics for me at all.  Don&#039;t get me wrong ... I really liked Ine&#039;s presentation preparing to travel and work for a year, but that&#039;s not why I go to Barcamp.     Maybe it was because people that normally wouldn&#039;t give a presentation were forced to give a presentation and came up with these kind of topics, or maybe it&#039;s because Barcamps have changed,  luckily there were different other talks tackling the Semantic Web, Hackerspaces etc  that did catch my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe the majority of Belgian Barcampers needs to realize that what they want is not a Barcamp but TwitCamp, Blogcamp or maybe even  LifeCamp,  For me topics such as Pension Plans,  Makeup, Beer, Travel Advice, etc don&#039;t belong on a Barcamp.  I`m not part or the Belgian Twitter and Bloggers community,  I`m part the Belgian Tech community, blogging on Open Source  and new technologies .  But when someone tells me &quot;Hey there the Paris Hilton of the Belgian Bloggers&quot; my reaction is ,wtf is Paris Hilton and why should I care&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/ehuard/barcamp-ghent2009&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; of Barcamp this year was a talk titled &quot;Where are my Keys&quot; ,  Elise was running around with a problem, and a partial solution,  the discussion and input during that talk could have lead to actuall building something and nferis nferis&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m not alone with this opinion, Some people already gave their opinion about the Belgian Barcamps buy just not showing up anymore ...  and in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.infil00p.org/blog/2009/08/27/barcamp-we-need-bazcamp/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;other parts&lt;/a&gt; of the world other barcamps seem to have the same problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barcamp has had his different spinoffs. There&#039;s GovCamp, MobileCamps, CaseCamp, NoSQLCamp, SQLCamp, CloudCamp, DemoCamp, LAMPCamp , WordCamps, DrupalCamps  and many more ... and you&#039;ll probably bump into me on the more specialized ones .. given enough Android topics you&#039;ll see me at a MobileCamp, you&#039;ll see me at &lt;a href=&quot;http://loadays.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LoadAys&lt;/a&gt; (a new conf on Linux and Open Source Administration topics), &lt;a href=&quot;http://devopsdays.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DevopsDays&lt;/a&gt; .  I hope to be able to go to the new and upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackerspace.be/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hackerspaces &lt;/a&gt; a bit more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless the next Barcamp heads back in another direction :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But until then...so long   thnx for al the fish&lt;/p&gt;
