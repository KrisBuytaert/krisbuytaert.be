 <title>Devops in Munich</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/devops-munich</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Devopsdays Mountainview sold out in a short 3 hours ..   but there&#039;s other events   that will breath devops this summer.&lt;br /&gt;
DrupalCon in Munich will be one of them ..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you might have noticed that I`m cochairing the devops track for DrupalCon Munich,&lt;br /&gt;
The CFP is open till the 11th of this month and we are still actively looking for speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re trying to bridge the gap between drupal developers and the people that put their code to production, at scale.&lt;br /&gt;
But also enhancing the knowledge of infrastructure components Drupal developers depend on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re looking for talks both on culture (both success stories and failure) ,   automation,&lt;br /&gt;
specifically looking for people talking about drupal deployments , eg using tools like Capistrano, Chef, Puppet,&lt;br /&gt;
We want to hear where Continuous Integration fits in your deployment ,  do you do Continuous Delivery of a drupal environment.&lt;br /&gt;
And how do you test ... yes we like to hear a lot about testing , performance tests, security tests, application tests and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
...  Or have you solved the content vs code vs config  deployment problem yet ? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are you measuring and monitoring these deployments and adding metrics to them  so you can get good visibility on both&lt;br /&gt;
system and user actions of your platform.  Have you build fancy dashboards showing your whole organisation the current state of your deployment ? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re also looking  for people talking about introducing different data backends,  nosql,  scaling different search backends , building your own cdn using  smart  filesystem setups.&lt;br /&gt;
Or making smart use of existing backends, such as tuning and scaling MySQL, memcached and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So lets make it clear to the community that drupal people do care about their code after they committed it in source control ! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please submit your talks &lt;a href=&quot;http://munich2012.drupal.org/news/call-for-papers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
