 <title>Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics, 2016 Edition</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/lies-damn-lies-and-statistics-2016-edition</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When people sign up for Configuration Management Camp, we ask them what community room they are mostly interested in.&lt;br /&gt;
We ask this question  because we have rooms in different sizes and we don&#039;t want to put communities with 20 people showing interest in a 120 seat room  and we don&#039;t want to put a community with 200 people in a 60 seat room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it also gives us to opportunity to build some very interesting graph over the potential evolution of the communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So looking at the figures ... the overall community is obviously growing,From 350 to 420, to just short of 600 people registered now.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Puppet Community is not the biggest anymore, that spot went to the Ansible Community room.   And all but the CFengine communities are growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.krisbuytaert.be/images/RoomSizes2016.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing ,  The organisation team discussed several times if we should rebrand the event.   We opted not to ..  Infracoders.eu  could have been an alternative name .. but we decided to stick with the name that already is known,&lt;br /&gt;
the content will evolve.. but Config Management Camp will stay the place where people that care about Infrastructure as Code and Infrastructure automation meet.&lt;/p&gt;
