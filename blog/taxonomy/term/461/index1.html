  <div class="content"><p>There is this  constant discussion about Open Core vs Open Source vs Proprietary Software , Fauxpen Source, Open Source  Business models etc.. you probably know all the usual  suspects involved,  first up lets agree that nobody will ever agree on what's best, (off course it's pure open source.. ) , but one of the important aspects is to know what values are important for you and your customers</p>
<p>Simon Phipps thinks we should <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/webmink/entry/building_a_scorecard_for_open" rel="nofollow">build</a> a scorecard that lists the different values we attach to a certain level of openness</p>
<p>He'd like a rating to questions such as , Is the license OSI-approved? ,  Is the copyright under diverse control?  ,Is the community governance open?,  Are external interfaces and formats standards compliant?  , Does your community operate under a patent peace arrangement?   Are trademarks community controlled? etc ..</p>
<p>Do we need one ?  <a href="http://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/2009/10/09/approving-and-disapproving-open-source-business-strategies-yes-or-no/" rel="nofollow">Matt Aslett</a> , whom I finally met last week in London , thinks not as it will has the knife will cut on both sides, but then also thinks yes  as it might clear up confusion to outsiders.</p>
<p>The comments on his post however is where the real discussion starts,  the one where the Open Core fanboy tells about HIS customers not caring,  and the Open Source zealots comment that the open core customers  don't care as they already settle for <a href="http://www.jejik.com/articles/2009/10/open_core_the_worst_of_both_worlds/" rel="nofollow">the best of worst world</a> (ok ok , I added that myselve :))</p>
<p>We are old and smart enough to decide ourselve .. aren't we ?  Fact is that plenty of us already use this kind of scorecards for themselves,  We prefer Open Source over Open Core , but still Open Core over proprietary software, we look at the community, we look at the source , we look at who's contributing and who's using.  Sometimes we value a vibrant user community over a vibrant contributing community , sometimes we don't like projects with only contributions from 1 company .. we do that exercize daily</p>
<p>On the other hand, as <a href="http://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/author/maslett/" rel="nofollow">Matthew Aslett</a> states, the outsiders probably don't know yet,  and as someone else in the discussion said, some customers are just stupid ..</p>
<p>Different Open Core vendors have different approaches,  we should use our own brains to  see the difference between  Marketing Driven company squashing out buggy but open code and  community driven company looking for a business model.  If you, such as Sander claims constantly are trying to outsmart your community , don't you think your customers will realize that ?</p>
<p>An aftertought If Simon Phipps gets his wish granted, what do we do with the blogs etc,  shouldn't <a href="http://news.cnet.com/openroad/" rel="nofollow">Matt</a> then change the subtitle of his blog to The business and politics of open core ?  and his title to Open Core Executive  to ? Or do we just call him the Richard Stallman of Open Core ?</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Repost from our <a href="http://www.inuits.be/news/enterprise-open-source-adoption-conference-bt-london">corporate blog</a></p>
<p>Last monday some <a href="http://www.inuits.be/">Inuits</a> quickly crossed the channel for a day of speeches and talks regarding Open Source and its Adoption, the event organised at BT brought together a mixture of techies, legal persons and management to listen to and discuss about the current state of Enterprise Open Source adoption</p>
<p>The short introduction was done by JP of Confused In Calcutta , who mainly introduced Mark "I`m from outer space" Shuttleworth. Mark keynoted about Ubuntu .. he talked about Aubergine being the new Brown ... ranted (as everybody) about the Cloud , talked about a stronger focus to services rather than product building , talked about the ecosystem of "people close to you" for supporting solutions .</p>
<p>Steve Bouch, of the Synapse Project at BT discussed ao the decisions they had to make, the varialbes they took in to account when starting<br />
to use Open Source , discussions such as the reputation of the project, the internal skill zet, the ease of importing and exporting data in and<br />
out of the project, and the different license terms were covered.</p>
<p>Andrew Katz , legal guy , who's also working on the International Free and Open Source Software Law Review gave an overview of the legal impact of Opensource . We learned that his customers have similar questions as ours, such as when to publish the code, what code to publish, when to look for alternative licenses etc</p>
<p>There was avid discussion regarding the Affero GPL license and using Open Source as a key component to build your killar webinfrastructure while not contributing back etc.</p>
<p>During the pannel discussion questions like Software Patents, and the fact that Ubuntu One won't be fully Open Source were tackled For us , most of the event was confirmation that what we are doing is the right thing to do, And that is worth a lot !</p>

  <div class="content"><p>There is once again a lot of fuzz going on about Open Source Business models,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.openlogic.com/blogs/2009/09/customers-not-thrilled-with-open-source-business-models-preferred-by-many-vcs-open-source-companies/" rel="nofollow">First on my eyballs was the article that Customers don't seem to like openCore</a>  what a big <a href="http://www.adventuresinoss.com/?p=611" rel="nofollow">surprise ..  </a></p>
<p>So that's not the one that makes the customers happy ,</p>
<p>Then there is the  other side of the coin, the people that create open source<br />
<a href="http://blogs.the451group.com/opensource/2009/09/15/oracle-could-kill-off-mysql-but-probably-wont/" rel="nofollow"> Authors realize the dual licensing model comes hunting back at you </a> after a merger or a hostile acquisition,   yes they still have the source code to build on  but they can't  sell commercial licenses to their customers anymore they way they used to.</p>
<p>So that's not the one that eventually makes the authors happy,</p>
<p>Then there is the RedHat model,  which tends to please a lot of people, which tends to be something traditional IT resellers can take in their portofolio, but partnering with a RedHat style company as an open source expert consultancy company isn't easy , as the expert consultancy companies have the knowledge themselves and won't push reselling subscriptions. </p>
<p>So that doesn't make the Distribution Vendors  happy</p>
<p>Back when XenSource came on the market we asked them if they could help us supporting some of our customers with Xen deployments, they didn't care they wanted to build a product and a fast exit ..</p>
<p>That didn't make us as an integrator nor the customer happy.</p>
<p>You'd think us opensource folks are really unhappy wouldn't you ?<br />
Wrong.. as we are all in it ..  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_for_Fun" rel="nofollow">Just for Fun</a></p>
<p>and the money!</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Somehow this year my schedule really isn't going to get filled with conferences,unlike my 13 speaking engagements last year this year I decided to go for a lot less :)</p>
<p>Froscon together with OpenSQLCamp is convienently scheduled during an already long planned family weekend ..  but I really hope to go there nex year</p>
<p>I've been wanting to go south for conferences for ages, Spain, France, Portugal, Italy , Greece are all places I'd love to go and see how the different Open Sourcen conferences play out there.  This summer there actually were some  different conferences tha took place in Spain, Gran Canaria etc .  but I coouldn't make it there  for the <a href="http://www.babietje.be/" rel="nofollow">obvious reasons..</a></p>
<p>The October conference schedule has another but similar problem , apart from <a href="http://www.t-dose.org/" rel="nofollow">T-Dose</a> which I plan on going to again, I`m doomed to miss <a href="http://www.linux-kongress.org/" rel="nofollow">LinuxKongress 2009 </a>  and the <a href="http://www.netways.de/en/osmc/y2009/uebersicht/" rel="nofollow">Open Source monitoring</a> conference as they both collide with <a href="http://www.devopsdays.org/" rel="nofollow">DevOpsDays</a></p>
<p>LinuxKongress  was initially scheduled for late september which meant it was on my planning but as they rescheduled  because of a conflict with the Linux Plumbers Conference at the other side of the ocean , it means that for the 2nd year in row I`ll miss LinuxKongress (last year was on purpose as I had already been to OLS)  ,</p>
<p>So I`m on the lookout for some new and exiting conferences to go to :)</p>
<p>There was an OpenSourceWorldConference in Malaga last couple of years , but their site hasn't been updated anymore for 2009 .. anyone knows what's going on there ?</p>

  <div class="content"><p><a href="http://www.rivermuse.org/" rel="nofollow">Rivermuse</a> is the new Fault Management platform tool on the market, their initial relase was lurking around the corner for a while now but since earlier this week it finally arrived</p>
<p>Eager to see what all the fuzz was about I jumped to their dowload page to find an yum repository for Fedora Core 9, that's right .. it's july 2009 and RiverMuse released their platform for a Linux distribution that got it's  End Of Life notice last month.</p>
<p>On a fresh Fedora 11 box off course you get a zillion dependency mismatches.<br />
So over to the source code.    After installing some build dependencies I managed to build desktop-trunk-8.fc11.noarch.rpm  rivermusece-trunk-8.fc11.noarch.rpm<br />
rpms</p>
<p>However these depend on extremely fresh versions of rsyslog &gt;= 4.1.6 where as Fedora 11 is only on 3.21 and RHEL is even only on 2.0.6.</p>
<p>The initial checkout I had had no README file yet .. so creating a build wasn't really easy ..</p>
<p>In the meanwhile they have promised builds for other versions.</p>
<p>So the battle is between me getting time to setup an FC9 box somehwere and they releasing fresher RPM's .. I hope they win :)</p>

<p>But I told you different things before ... and some of you listened others are still reinventing the wheel as we go ...</p>
<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10249201-16.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=TheOpenRoad" rel="nofollow">Matt A.</a>  points out that the OpenBravo folks <a href="http://paolojuvara.blogspot.com/2009/05/extend-dont-customize.html" rel="nofollow">realized</a> that one should try to build on top of Open Source projects rather than modify core code ..</p>
<p>Wonder where he <a href="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/open-source-does-not-mean-customization-heaven">read that before</a> :<cite><br />
Some projects are prepared for local contributions, they have a modular framework that allows you to build on top of the project while not having to touch the core of a project, Drupal and openQRM are great examples of those, but not all projects are that smart. Needless to say that when you have such a modular framework you really shouldn't be modifying the core part of the platform, unless you are fixing a real bug.<br />
</cite></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2009/05/21/open-development-vs-making-a-big-splash/" rel="nofollow">Over at the MySQLPerformance blog, Peter </a> points out that  Open source projects <a href="http://virtualization.com/guest-posts/2009/03/17/floss-virtualization-doesnt-care-about-marketing-../" rel="nofollow">don't do</a> big fat marketing campaigns and the community doesn't appreciate features being developed in a corner then being released with a big bang ...  we prefer our releases Early and Often...</p>
<p>On Automating Software installations, a  <a href="http://everythingsysadmin.com/2009/05/gorillas-in-the-mist-or-sysadm.html" rel="nofollow">Tom Limoncelli</a> about how we install software and debug setups,  with a nice quote  <cite>"Oh my god.  Is that why nobody uses the GUI we spend millions to develop?"</cite>.<br />
Well <a href="http://madstop.com/" rel="nofollow">Luke</a> said it before .<cite>. If my computer can't install it .. the installer is broken <cite></cite></cite></p>
<p><a href="http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/2009/05/partner-programs-and-open-source-software-businesses.html" rel="nofollow">Stephen Walli</a> has some good toughts on how Open Source vendors should setup their partner programs,  indeed with their eyes wide open ..</p>
<p>I ranted on Open Source Vendors thinking they should still work with partners models and the channel the traditional way <a href="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/open-source-channel">before</a></p>
<p>However I have to admit that over the last month I did talk to people that do understand <a href="http://www.inuits.be/">our</a> Love / Hate relation ship with the Open Source Vendors that want to partner with us ..  and that some of the newer Open Source Vendors are actually attracted by our different way of tackling partnerships.</p>
<p>Oh well.. as <a href="http://blogs.opennms.org/" rel="nofollow">Tarus</a> says .. my 3 readers understand..</p>
