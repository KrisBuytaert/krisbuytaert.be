 <title>Sharing Calendars</title>
 <link>http://127.0.0.1:8080/blog/node/736</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.contenthere.net/2008/10/business-time.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Seth&lt;/a&gt; is having the same problems I have, sharing your calendar with different groups of people.  Where some of these groups have their own system in place already.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only he has a partial solution for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m looking for a step further..  it could probably be called Calendar Delegation.&lt;br /&gt;
I kind of would like to have 1 calendar that I manage and based on from where you see that calendar you get detailed information or just free busy.   So my favorite customer would see if I`m at their office or not&lt;br /&gt;
and if I`m having meetings at their office, however whem I`m not at their office they would just see a busy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My collegues should however be able to see that I`m at a customer but not having any meetings there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I should only have to manage everything in one place while for my customers they should  just be able to see it in their calendar solution  flavor of the week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man can dream right ? :)&lt;/p&gt;
