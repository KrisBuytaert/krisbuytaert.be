  <div class="content"><p>Not even <a href="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/?q=node/520">that long ago </a> I  discussed  Innovation in Open Source projects .. </p>
<p>Let me refresh your memory...<br />
<cite> Call me oldfashioned but I still think of most of the closed source shops as 9to5 developers that write code because their boss tells them. Their boss is being instructed by clueless marketing people that promise impossible features to customers with impossible deadlines. An Open Source developer writes code because he wants to fix something , because he needs a feature , not because someone tells him to do so. To there is much more passion to be found in the heart of an open source developer than in your average closed shop developer.</cite></p>
<p>Now add <a href="http://www.michaeldolan.com/1058" rel="nofollow">Michael Dolan</a> 's comments on Open Source projects lead and managed by a sole corporate with no  actual community to my notes.</p>
<p>Then try to understand why <a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2007-12/sunflash.20071205.1.xml" rel="nofollow"> Sun announces this</a> , now I wonder ..  what are they going to pay people for .. features that the corporate product management wants, or features the community wants ?  There is money involved .. so who will be calling the shots ?<br />
I hope they make the right choices .. I really do !</p>
<p>But I'm afraid Sun still doesn't understand how to play with the opensource  crowd.  They try .. but run into too much walls  As Michael notes , you can hardly call Open Solaris a succesfull open source project as it still doesn't have a real community.   I hope one day they will realise that , drop their commercially driven doomed to fail open projects   and start contributing to some projects with a real community.  It took them a while to figure out the right thing to do with Java .. I`m sure they'll learn  and figure out this time also :)</p>
<p>Sun isn't the only one not to understand how the community works..   but it's one of the most public ones that needs our help.</p>
<p>So what have we learned so far ..<br />
* Open Sourcing an end of life proprietary proprietary does not work<br />
* Managing an Open Source in oldschool inhouse proprietary style doesn't work</p>
<p>And lots more ...</p>

  <div class="content"><p><a href="http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/database/tarrysingh/archives/ngmdc-next-generation-mashup-datacenter-open-and-closed-source-all-mashed-up-20772" rel="nofollow">Over at ITToolbox</a> Tarry has another blog .  He posted an article where he tried to debunk some myths about open source.     I feel he needs some help there :)</p>
<p>Let's start with his second Myth , Open Source is Free.   Off course it isn't , you need to invest your own time to get familiar with it  or pay other people to use it.    Compare it to building a house ... you can build one if you have the skills and the time , but you still need to pay for the bricks and the mortar, or you can pay someone who has the skills  to build one for you.   With software there used to be a similar thing.  You could buy software, then install and configure it yourselve,  or you could hire someone more skilled than you to install and support it when you run into problems.     Now take away the fact that you have to buy bricks and mortar , or for this case the software.    That's Free Software..    you still need to spend time to get to know the tools or pay someone to do that for you.  Depending on what the core business of your ogranization is .. the choice is your.  </p>
<p>Tarry says <cite><br />
BUT it remains a product that you need to get support. Just like Windows or Oracle database.<br />
</cite> Which I don't agree with .. the fact is that I never can get the same level of experience and knowledge myselve on a product such as Windows or Oracle as I can on Linux and MySQL ,  I can't dig in to the source code of the first 2 products <cite><br />
In fact, Oracle is a better example, its an open source, right?<br />
</cite>  Whoow,  when did that happen .. during which long vacation did I miss Oracle being Open Sourced ?  Yes Oracle contributes a lot to open source but Oracle itselve being Open ... I must have missed that..</p>
<p><cite>People won't notice but you'd have a huge application running on it in no time and you'd be stuck to that "free version" for the rest of your life. Or you choose to eventually buy the software support and even end up paying the license fee. Ha! Vendor lock Alarm!</cite><br />
Now there is a skyhigh difference between a limited featureset product that is free  to download  but not free to use in a production environment and and opensource which is free to download, to use, to modify and to contribute to.   Yes there are people making a business model of supporting that piece of software but they don't force you to buy anything from them. It's a pretty sensible thing to buy services from the people that actually wrote the code , but  you are free to buy the same services from someone else, someone local, someone who speaks your languag   And they will be able to read the code and fix the problems. </p>
<p>Look at a proprietary product where you want a feature changed or a critical bug fixed.<br />
You can call your local supplier,  who can't do anything else but call his reseller who will escalate to the vendor.  There is no way your local integrator will actually be able to modify the product and fix the problem.  However  You or an open source integrator  with the appropriate skills can take the code of the product, study it and fix the problems. After which off course they will contribute these changes back to the community.  I see no vendor lock in there.</p>
<p><CITE><br />
Simply because no matter how small you are, you wouldn't want to risk you application on this product, you'd rather go for a full support. Same applies to the "open source" cousin! Do you really think that running Centos, Whitebox, Ubuntu etc without licensing and regular patching is a sustainable option. no sweetheart, it isn't no where. There are however places where you can carry on for a while with this scenario, but not for long.</cite><br />
Yes you need to patch your system in a timely manner, but I don't see where you could License Centos or Whitebox or a big set of other Open Source projects such as Apache etc.<br />
There are different good reasons to buy support and services , you might want to financially stimulate and support the people that wrote the code so they can continue to write it,  you might want to have an insurance for your boss  when things go wrong ,  you might have a long history of making too much IT expenses, or you are forced to buy a certified product because yet another vendor only wants to work on a certified products.   But risk for instability on the open source side is not amongst the list of reasons.    If you have the appropriate skills and time nothing is blocking you from supporting yourselve.  There is absolutely no need to buy a license from someone .  So carry on .. </p>
<p>On Open Source Innovation..<cite><br />
Innovation happens at the heart of the open source with as much fury as in a "Closed Source" shop.<br />
</cite> Call me oldfashioned but I still think of most of the closed source shops as 9to5 developers that write code because their boss tells them.  Their boss is being instructed by clueless marketing people that promise impossible features to customers with impossible deadlines.  An Open Source developer writes code because he wants to fix something , because he needs a feature , not because someone tells him to do so. To there is much more passion to be found in the heart of an open source developer than in your average closed shop developer.    </p>
<p>Innovation is not happening in the Closed Source shops anymore.  Innovation is happening out in the open.  </p>
<p>Tarry,  guess we need to grab some beers to discuss this further  , but I feel we'll have an opportunity coming up pretty soon :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I spent way too much time this weekend trying to get the <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/file/includes/pager.inc/5" rel="nofollow">pager</a> stuff in Drupal working for a module I`m playing with.  </p>
<p>I had learned a lot from the watchdog module on how paging was supposed to be working and I was trying to do the same with another database.    As I got a page limited by the number of records I wanted but I couldn't find any of the fancy next, previous and page number thingies that I wanted.    </p>
<p>The watchdog module worked for me and I started stripping the watchdog module till I could actually replace my function with watchdog_overview function.    Even replaced the watchdog query with my qeury..  but not such luck.. I couldn't get   $output .= <span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text">theme('pager', NULL, 50, 0);</code></span>  to work.</p>
<p>So as every open source geek does.. I started looking into the code.  pager.inc<br />
The header told me  the author.. I could mail him and wait or even call him , , but I read on.<br />
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text">$pager_total_items[$element] = db_result(db_query($count_query, $args));</code></span><br />
Never returned  anything useful.., my mysql log learned me there never was any query with a count ..<br />
Till I modified the pager.inc file to actually perform the query I wanted it to do.. and it started working.<br />
Then I took a closer look at the regexp that was being used to create the $count_qeury<br />
<span class="geshifilter"><code class="text geshifilter-text">$count_query = preg_replace(array('/SELECT.*?FROM /As', '/ORDER BY .*/'), array('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ', ''),$query);</code></span><br />
However my query was all in lowercase so the count was never inserted.</p>
<p>The only difference between the working watchdog module and my own code was in the use of uppercase SQL statements.<br />
So call me lazy :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p><a href="http://arjen-lentz.livejournal.com/98238.html" rel="nofollow">Arjen</a> wonders why the MySQl Cluster Study book is published on Lulu and not trough MySQL 's traiditional publisher.</p>
<p>Altough I was involved in the creation process of the mentionned book, I have no idea why this decision was made but to me it makes perfect sense.   MySQL Cluster is a piece of software that is still going to change a lot in the next couple of months and years.<br />
A book published in a traditional way needs a minimal sales volume in order to be worth publishing.  If there even is a slight chance that by the time the book gets published a significant amount of content of the book has already changed traditional publishers shouldn't publish the book. Now over at Lulu.com a book won't be print before a customer orders it.  So when the book is being sent to me.   I get the current version of the book..   If in 3 months the authors decide to rewrite a chapter or make some bugfixes.   The book can be updated much faster.<br />
I can imagine that people buying the same title in april next year will already get bugfixes on the version that will arrive at my doorstep in a couple of days.      </p>
<p>At least that's why I would publish a technical book on Lulu.</p>

  <div class="content"><p><a href="http://tarrysingh.blogspot.com/2007/12/10-or-100-virtualization-vendors-to.html" rel="nofollow">Tarry</a> is pointing us to a couple of companies that he thinks we should watch  in the Virtualization area next year.</p>
<p>He's right.. these are exactly the kind of companies we will watch die fast in the next couple of years.   All proprietary vendors,  placing a bet on becoming the next datacenter integrator are are placing their money on the wrong side of evolution.</p>
<p>Why on earth would a sane IT manager want to  bet his infrastructure on a 3rd party tool that implements on top of a proprietary vendor ?  Because he wants to be locked into an infrastructure where he looses control over what he wants to be running ?  Does he want an environment  where he will be forced to puzzle together functionality he really wants by trying to integrate different proprietary vendors that won't play along ?</p>
<p>Heck haven't we learned enough over the last decades .. the key to growth is interoperability and openness.  That's how the web was build .. it wasn't build buy 100 proprietary software vendors setting up a different service you could talk to with different fat management client all trying to accomplish the same features.</p>
<p>If you still haven't understood that .. please move one ... but don't bother me.</p>

<p>After a long wait it's finally out !<br />
In contrary to the other one, this book took over a year to finish  because there was actually a lot of reviewing done by different people. </p>
<p>You can buy it now  <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1297960" rel="nofollow"> at Lulu.com</a> !</p>

She should understand something like "remind me before" in order for me to meet a deadline in time :)</p>
<p>Apart from that.. I think 1 Sandy is enough and I already have one :)</p>
<p>So I disabled it..</p>
