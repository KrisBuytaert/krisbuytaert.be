<p>My ISP is playing tricks on me again .. flaky ADSL connection going up and down ..  again,  It has been stable for  a couple of weeks/months now but since tonight things are unstable again.</p>
<p>Yesterdays L2U was really crowded,  even people from .nl stopped by. Xen really is a hot topic it seems.</p>
<p>My External 160Gb drive for Backups arrived.. finally I won't have to worry about crashing disks again, hmm.. well.. 4 different locations where the pics are stored, the external one will probably crash first, but at least next time I'll visit my parents they will get a copy also :)</p>
<p>Building openMosix 2.6.14 stuff , my spec file seems broken, I documented how to fix it, but pointed to a link, which doesn't work with my adsl connection broken.<br />
So by the time I veventually will get around to publish this I'd better hit the sheets :)</p>

      <div class="submitted">
          <span class="author">By: Kris Buytaert</span>
            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>Most of us techies don't like writing documentation, and the lack of good tools certainly doesn't help there.  And with good tools I don't mean vi or emacs, but a tool to collect and manage documents so that you can share and collaborate.   Tools such as Knowledgthree can contain documents and you can search for them, but the moment you want to modify them you have to take a couple of steps too much, you have to download, edit locally in most of the time some hughe textprocessor (Yes, we do need a LightWeight version of OpenOffice.org !)  and then upload it again.</p>
<p>On the other hand you want to force people in using templates so that the output one generates stays clear and consistent,   so what you want is people to write docbook, but you also want people who don't know docbook to be able to modify and contribute to the document.  Then one should be able to apply the appropriate style sheets and publish the document.</p>
<p>The Hula Project has a similar <a href="http://www.hula-project.org/Wiki_Conversion">problem</a>  and the are probaly not the only ones.<br />
We currently are looking at <a href="http://doc-book.sourceforge.net/homepage/">Docbookwiki</a> for some tasks ..it's looking good, but it still needs a lot of work to be done to get it into a state where everybody can use it.<br />
And then we haven't even touched shared images in the document yet :)</p>
<p>I`m still sticking with vi to write Docbook and my Makfiles ,  I`ll throw the files in SVN so the others can pick em up in Docbookwiki :)</p>

  <div class="content"><p> I started reading  <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?path=ASIN/0471430269&amp;link_code=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;tag=everytisafine-21&amp;creative=6738">Blueprints for High Availability</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=everytisafine-21&amp;l=as2&amp;o=2&amp;a=0471430269" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> since it was mentionned multiple times in different threads ao. by <a href="http://lars.marowsky-bree.de/">LMB.</a> (eheh.. by looking up this link I noticed Lars updated his homepages and started blogging :))</p>
<p>
If you ever plan on doing something that's higly available and you want to know where to start this is a must read,  to be honest I was expecting more "Ah , so this is how you should do it " kind of things rather than<br />
"Hmm.. yeah .. that's the way I do it" ..  but that's probably  more because of my background than because of the content of the book.
</p>
<p></p><P>I also found them to be a bit to short on the fact that security is also an important  part of High Availability since if your systems are compromised they aren't available anymore, let's blame that on my security background :)
</p>
<p>
If you are looking for a  Hands on guide on how to build a HA cluster, this is not the book you need :)   But I`m still not sure which book I should advise you to read then .., but this is the book you should have read before that one</p>
<p>I still want to repeat the most important rule in HA here :<b>Keep it Simple !</b></p>

<p>Such as reinstalling some laptops that are still on Redhat 9 which now have been upgraded to Ubuntu , such as trying to fix the disks in my x220  so that my backups and picture archive are actually safe , trying to get a working kernel for my Hompaq with a crappy SATA RAID controller ,  so that it can be used for my cluster tests  and trying to get some color on my HTPC when in X. (It s in color when it boots in text mode but it's in greyscale when in X, must be the TV-Set itselve) , and trying to get the HP PSC 2355 to also work as a scanner (the 2350 is listed to work but the 2355 currently only prints)  and finishing a couple of articles that I have been working on :)<br />
There's an openpower machine from IBM at the office that I haven't even looked at for more than 5 minutes .. luckily some of the other collegues have :)  And the Nokia 770 is changing owner every couple of days at the office, I can wait . I don't have time to play with it anyway ..</p>
