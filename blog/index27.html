<p>It was a pretty lousy comparison actually ..  they compared Open Source software to a Free Puppy.. it looks nice and cheap at first  but it will cost you anyhow as it needs food  and shots etc so it isn't really free after all.</p>
<p>Now the fact is that with the proprietary stuff they are trying to shove down their customers throats, their CMS's also need configuration, updates, and styling left and right,   probably just as much as the Open Source alternative out there.<br />
Now as they have a proprietary platform the chance that they have an equally big expert group around their product is small, people don't just buy software to learn it,  however they will download a piece of interesting open source software to get aquanted with it..  There probably won't be that much free examples and tips and hints a round, or even free themes to base a site on ..</p>
<p>So no the purebred puppy really isn't the better alternative it's going to cost you equally in maintenance and you have to pay the high cost to actually be able to play with it .. or did you think it would be your software after you payed the pricetag ?</p>
<p>Now there's more bad news for the purebred software buyer.  He isn't free to go to any vet, no , he has to go to a specialized one in his breed,  actually if he doesn't do so once.. he risks  never to be helped by another one in the future either.<br />
And no choosing which food to buy for the puppy, no ther's just 1 brand that works, or maybe 2 .. but the prices have been set .. and it won't be cheap.</p>
<p>So what do you want .. the freedom to go to any vet you like, and to buy dogfood where you want , or even give them some  of your own leftovers.  Or the heavy pricetag, AND the limited choice in vets and food.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>If you've been reading this blog for a while you'll know that<br />
for the past decade I've had a love-hate relation ship with Sun.     </p>
<p>Sun has done a lot of good things in their open source journey  such as MySQL, openOffice , Virtualbox  and  opensourcing Java.  But on the other hand they had troubles with creating really organic opensource.  </p>
<p>I've always wondered why a company that bought StarDivision because it was cheaper than buying the MS Office license keeps wasting money on building it's own operating systems, albeit in a pretty open model, but with zero to no relevant community.</p>
<p>Yes I've ranted on their marketing boys and girls when they polluted forums I liked.    But no I don't want <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/perlow/?p=9343" rel="nofollow">this</a> to happen. (Slicing up Sun) </p>
<p>However I`m in fear it actually might happen, the funny thing is that I already mentioned the same idea in offline conversations during the last couple of months.</p>
<p>My Advice to Sun.  : Stop putting money in things you can co-create  with other organisations,  if there's only 2 features in your product that count for some people,   contribute those 2 features to something bigger.<br />
(That's D-Trace and ZFS and the Linux Kernel I`m talking about in case you didn't realise)  Why keep throwing money down the drain ? </p>
<p>Also let Google, Percona and others contribute to MySQL, don't keep it as closed as it is today.  As after al it's more Free software than it is Open Source, but it has a great community which I love to be part of .. and I hope for a long time to come..</p>
<p>I`m going to try to keep my mouth shut on this for a while.. as I think   <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/" rel="nofollow">Jonathan</a> is listening anyhow.   If he was, he would have known that at some point in time when you step out of the shower and there is too much hair dropping from your skull every morning, it's time to cut off the <a>ponytail..</a> , not <a href="http://www.sun.com/ponytail/" rel="nofollow">opensource it</a>.  I did that years ago.. and it's growing much thicker again now. </p>
<p>My hair that is ..</p>

  <div class="content"><p>My mother suggested that she would babysit while the 2 of us went out to eat yesterday.  The idea was to have a good dinner in one of the restaurants that took part of the <a href="/blog/restaurantweek/index.html">Restaurantweek.be</a> action.</p>
<p>The idea is that you get a 3 course dinner for 25 Euro a person in a good quality restaurant .. therefore no brasserie or pubfood.  With different of the top restaurants of antwerp taking part of the action we decided to pic a new one we didn't know yet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.brancherestaurants.com/" rel="nofollow">Branche Restaurant</a> , which is  the restaurant of the new Golden Tulip Hotel next to the Antwerp Train station.</p>
<p>When we arrived there yesterday we got asked for a voucher for the 2 for 1 action.   We were pretty clueless at that point as we never heard of the 2 for 1 action.  We were there for a culinary action  from Restaurantweek. </p>
<p>The menu for the evening was going to be schrimp salad, pepper steak and tiramisu.     WTF ?   I can make that myselve,  or If I`m hungry and I need to eat that's what I grab in a tavern, that's not what I wan't to have when I go out to eat !</p>
<p>But it was only going to cost us 25 euro for the 2 of us claimed the waiter.<br />
Well.. we had to eat anyhow so why not ..</p>
<p>Somehow they forgot we had ordered one steak well done, and neglected to ask about how the other one.   So we sent the rare steak back to the kitchen.  I actualy had to get up and go ask where it stayed after about 20 minutes.  By then the fries were cold..  so I asked for new ones.. by the time we got those.. the steak was cold.     We got offered a free drink for the delay .. but never saw that drink anyhow.</p>
<p>We had dessert ... and asked for the check ..    obviously I was kind of surprised that they had charged us 2x 25 Euro, unlike  what they had told us upfront.<br />
The waiter explained that he didn't know about the Restaurantweek arrangement and he mistakenly assumed we had the other , the 2 for 1 offer,   the 2 for one offer got that menu for 39 Euros for 2 persons.    And well.. they had given us the same menu for 2x25 euro ..</p>
<p>We weren't there for some cheapo fries and steak in the first place.. we went there for a culinary dish.    And 39 euro's for that menu would have been a big RipOff anyhow.    The only reason why we accepted the offer was because it was damn cheap and we had to eat anyhow.      So now we had had crappy and way to expensive  food,  and bad service as well and we were inadvertedly  informed that most of the tables around us that actually  had the 2for1 offer even paid 10 euro less for the same menu.</p>
<p>Upon asking for a "btwbonneke" the waitress was absolutely clueless, c'mon .. if you work in a restaurant in Belgium you have to know what a 'btw-bonneke' is.<br />
She didn't , luckily her collegue knew.</p>
<p>So Restaurantweek really should have communicated better with their restaurants that people signing up for the offer expect something different from Steak with Fries and a small schrimp salad upfront.</p>
<p>And as for the Branche Restaurant service .. well..   guess you'll never see us again ..  and I gues you'll never see the table that was sitting next to us again either.    The least you should have done was actually give us the menu for 39Euro's like some of the other tables and give us another drink as you had promised anyhow.</p>
<p>But all you got now .. was bad publicity.  But then again .. you won't go bankrupt ..as you are part of a hotel, and a hotel needs a restaurant anyway  so why should you bother in the first place.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>As some of you know I run Fedora on my main Laptop, and Ubuntu on my EEE and my office Desktop.   My Ubuntu installs were pretty fresh, but my fedora was long due for an upgrade.    As after years of abuse (--force --nodeps) it usually is impossible to do a regular upgrade, so my best way out was a quick and fresh install on an isolated root partition.   (my /home/ etc live on separate volumes)</p>
<p><a href="http://raskas.be/" rel="nofollow">Johan</a> tricked me into installing a FC10 x86-64 setup which required some more work than usual, but I`m back in the same state as I was before I started the upgrade.  We'll almost .. as I expect I`ll be reinstalling packages I don't daily use on a frequent basis over the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>I'll dig a bit deeper in my x86_64 struggles later but first I had to tackle the problems I had with stepping my Evolution to a fresh and hopefully more stable version.</p>
<p>Evolution fails to recognise  the fact that I have multiple calendars, or got confused.. anyway .. my calendar was empty and I had to recreate them all and import them again one by one.<br />
Luckily the content was still available in .ics</p>
<p>Also Evolution partly forgot about all my email accounts , it remembered their passwords after recreating them, but not their settings.. well. that is if I managed to recreate them all :)<br />
(If I`m not replying to a mail you sent me sinc last thursday.. I might just have forgotten about that email address ..</p>
<p>On to the x86_64 stuff then.  <a href="http://blog.verwilst.be/" rel="nofollow">Bort</a> pointed me to the<br />
<a href="http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html" rel="nofollow">Adobe Labs site</a> that had a working flash plugin.  The right symlink in my .mozilla/plugins and the first problem was solved.</p>
<p>There's 2 apps from Google that I sometimes abuse,  I don't know why I still use Picasa, there must be plenty of good open source alternatives out there ..  however for Google Earth I don't really have a good alternative.   bot work  (unlike previous Fedora/Googl Earth combinations)</p>
<p>The only thing that annoyed me was Google Earth and selinux  , I had to run some chcon s to solve the problems.</p>

<p>A couple of more frustrations later  and the SELinux config got changed.  Afterall .. Life is to short for SELinux.</p>
<p>A must,  if you used too have Livna , or FreshRPMS is <a href="http://rpmfusion.org/" rel="nofollow">RPMFusion</a> a merger of the old repositories</p>
<p>Skype  seemed to be a bit more difficult.  I tried installing the rpm at first but I failed , then I read  <a href="http://liquidat.wordpress.com/2008/11/27/moving-on-64bit-linux-pulseaudio-fedora-10-and-so-on/" rel="nofollow">some tips</a> which suggested to use yum localinstall skype*.rpm</p>
<p>As I`m more of an apt-get user (yes even on CentOS etc) I don't usually try installing packages that way .. but it worked like a charm.    Skype started,  I could connect to the servers , however a test call  reveals no input sound.  Maybe if I try again with a headset later.</p>
<p>Anyway,  I`m pretty satisfied so far ...</p>
<p>Next step is to get that skype chat integrated in pidgin.. or hope people will realize they have to drop that proprietary tool one day..</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I predicted it to some people and it actually became true :( </p>
<p>I just removed myselve from tomorrows <a href="http://barcampgent2.wikispaces.com/" rel="nofollow">BarcampGent 2</a>  subscription list.</p>
<p>It seems I can make it to most of the "odd" issues of Belgian Barcamps,   I made it to BarcampBrussels, BarcampBrussels3 and the first BarcampGent,  but for the Even Barcamps , Brussels2 and 4 and now Gent2 there always seems to be something that eventually blocks me from going.     Just like with the BXL edition family priorities kicked in.</p>
<p>Anyway .. have fun tomorrow .. I`ll be thinking of you folks<br />
and see you next time :)</p>
