      <div class="submitted">
          <span class="author">By: Kris Buytaert</span>
            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>I know.. Fosdem is already over for almost 2 weeks.  But I was <a href="http://www.x-tend.be/~kb/blog/index.php?2007/03/05/332-to-write-or-not-to-write">busy writing other stuff</a>  , so I`m catching up now.</p>
<p>Sounds weird, but somehow eventhough fosdem is getting crowdier every year it also seems to be better organised.<br />
The focus is moving away from the main conference track and into the hallway and devroom tracks.  That's where the people meet.</p>
<p>Matt and I arrived rather early at Fosdem on saturday ,   for once that RMS wasn't giving a keynote I took the opportunity to actually go there and catch parts of both the OLPC and the Java talk.  Nothing new about the first one,  Sun marketing in the second one.  I`m not used to the kind of talks Simon Phipps gave,  this was more a commercial or a TV show trying to entertain the audience rather than actually teach them stuff. hmm.. probably that's why they call it a KeyNote.      The <a href="http://www.madstop.com/">Puppet community</a> kind of arranged to meet at 1400 at the entrance of the <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2007/schedule/devroom/centosfedora">Centos/Fedora room</a> , so I tried to catch a glimp of Luke there and succeeded.   <a href="http://www.karan.org/blog/">Karanbir</a> had kindly offered his timeslot for Puppet talk on sunday.<br />
After lots of other hallway encounters, pointing me to a really nice <a href="http://www.x-tend.be/~kb/blog/index.php?2007/03/04/330-nluug-najaarsconferentie-2007">NLUUG Virtualisation Conference Schedule</a> and the <a href="http://www.x-tend.be/~kb/blog/index.php?2007/03/04/331-t-dose-future">new dates for T-Dose</a>, I managed to see the LinuxBios talk,  I really should spend some time looking at this .. some day ..</p>
<p>After this talk I headed back to the CentOS room to see <a href="http://www.arrfab.net/">Fabian talk about eID</a>,  then Federic about OpenVZ  , realised that I really should spend time looking at <a href="http://directory.fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora Directory Server</a>,  it should be really familiar, as in august it will only be 7 years since I took the IPlanet Directory Service training in London :) , auch .. time flies when you're having fun at the open side ;) Things I wrote down from FedoraDS were the multimaster replication , the Virtual Views you can use when organisations realise they should have paid you for the formal LDAP analysis , Chaining of directories and much more.</p>
<p>After the last talk from Dab about RPMForge we had a photoop :)</p>
<p><img src="http://www.x-tend.be/~kb/images/DSC00034.JPG" alt="" /></p>
<p>Yes, that's the whole RPMforge team for you.</p>
<p>A bunch of us headed out to De Appel in Leuven for Drinks an Food.<br />
I drove back Luke and Karanbir to their hotels only to get stuck in traffic in Brussels.</p>
<p>I was looking forward to <a href="http://isecom.org/">Pete Herzog's talk on OSSTMM</a> on Sunday morning,  it feels like ages ago since I was closely involved in the OSSTMM project , I had a 2 minute chat with Pete before he flew back to Barcelona but it was worth getting up early .  If I could find that  26hoursaday patch I'd probably jump back into it.</p>
<p>Max Spevack finished his Future of Fedora talk early so I could still catch the end of <a href="http://buytaert.net/">the Drupal talk</a>  While hurrying back to <a href="http://wraptastic.org/">Jeff Johnsons</a> talk on the current state of RPM  , I bumped into Roland,  JJ talked a lot about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/xar/">xar</a> , also something to look into.</p>
<p>Before Lance could start his CentOS roadmap talk I ran into Lenz and Roland but couldn't find them again after I finished my sandwich :(</p>
<p>One of the talks that  I will be remembering was <a href="http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/">stpeter's</a> 1 slide per second talk.  Great stuff.. really kept you focussed and meaningful content also, not just marketing crap.  Only too bad he didn't provide a ful solution yet.  Time wil..</p>
<p>Fosdem kept the best for last,  Luke's Puppet talk, I've mentoinned puppet before in this blog,  so you kind of know why I keep mentionning this.<br />
I taped his whole talk with my mobile.  The video quality isn't really good, but the sound is reasonable. I should probably check with Luke to put it online somewhere in a usable format ;)</p>
<p>After Luke's talk I went home and started the recovery process , which took till ..  well.. now :)</p>

<p>It was great meeting Jan again after all those years,  they are doing cool stuff with Xen and Storage .. but you can read all about that on their website.</p>
<p>On one hand it's kind of weird how altough people might be involved in similar technologies and with similar interrests, living only 50 Km away from eachothe   yet still don't know from eachother.   On the other hand , eventually you'll meet :)</p>
<p>Keep watching that Qlayer site as I`m sure that there will be good stuff coming from there soon.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Couple of weeks ago Filip pointed us again to <a href="http://openchange.org/">OpenChange</a> on our internal mailinglist.</p>
<p>As after 42 seconds their website I wasn't sure if they were working on a client or a server<br />
application. I asked him for more</p>
<p>Here's his (partial) reply</p>
<blockquote><p>no, serieously, they are essentially working on reverse engineering the MAPI<br />
protocol and providing proof-of-concept code &amp; libraries, so that<br />
any other project (evolution, all oss mail server projects, ...) can offer<br />
exchange &amp; outlook compatibility.</p>
<p>
wrt zimbra, ... all fine&amp;dandy and all that, but completely useless in<br />
99% of corporate<br />
environments as you need to have something with calendering/colaboration<br />
features that is completely compatible with a out-of-the box outlook client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fully agree with him regarding to converting braindead people who<br />
don't realise the fact that Outlook is their major reason for Viri  this<br />
is a good step.</p>
<p>I however hope to be able to convince people that they should give up<br />
their old habits because they are causing them nothing but problems.</p>
<p>It's like getting people to stop smoking,  yes smoking kills, everybody<br />
knows it but still people  continue to do so at the cost of the<br />
community and the governement.<br />
Sometimes people try to stop and use patches  , for me OpenChange is<br />
such a patch  , I don't get to smell their smoke anymore.. but they are<br />
still killing themselves softly.</p>
<p>So <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/">Zimbra</a>, <a href="http://www.open-xchange.com/">OpenXchange</a>, and recently also the freed <a href="http://www.scalix.com/">Scalix</a> are better alternatives !</p>

<p>So took the To Write option and somehow managed to make a crazy deadline.<br />
I`m curious to see what the final result will look like.<br />
I`m not 300% satisfied with the work I did but given the short timeframe It should be rather OK.  I however would have wanted much more content in there for which I obviously had not enough time.</p>

<p>Actually I can't remember the day we started doing this.. it must have been ages ago.<br />
And I also don't even remember which developers I bought dinner already ..<br />
(I`m not even gonna try listing at which conferences I paid the bills)</p>
<p>But .. is that so unusual ?  I have a couple of collegues that also just do this.. they go out after a conference and  buy the core members of their favourite project some drinks or food, just because they appreciate what others are doing.</p>
