  <div class="content"><p>Most people blog about the new year in their first article.   Seems like I already posted stuff earlier this year</p>
<p>First of all.. I`m wondering  If spam has been slowing down the last couple of weeks (oops shouldn't have asked probably)  nevertheless<br />
I`m about to close down a couple of old email accounts,  I`m in the process of moving away some old mailinglist to more relevant accounts and I`m still in some suppliers databases with really old addresses.  But still will we ever find a way to punish a spammer good enough so that he stops spamming.  The sad thing is that there are probably too much idiots out there that buy stuff from spammers , otherwise spam would have died ages ago.  So the real question is, how do we prevent braindead people from using the internet.</p>
<p>Some people think it's time for a new internet,  an internet where only people that know how to manage their machines are allowed, a network that can't be poisoned by zombie machines becasue noone will be allowed to connect a machine that could go zombie.  Will it ever happen ?</p>
<p>As usual 2007 will be a big year for lots of people,  zillion of startups out there that really need to make some money now<br />
Each year is always a big year for someone :)  A couple of people told me last year that 2007 was going to be the year <em>they</em> were going to start up a new company.   You know who you are,  I wish you all the luck with your new efforts.    And for all the others .. keep going !</p>

<p>There's a petition doing the rounds to ask the Council to do the right thing. <a href="http://www.petitionspot.com/petitions/eu_streaming_service_for_everybody">Please sign it!</a></p>
<p>We can't tolerate that on one side the EU fights against a monopoly, and on the other side it discriminates against people not using products from the monopolist !</p>

      <div class="submitted">
          <span class="author">By: Kris Buytaert</span>
            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>I've had the MacMini sitting at my desk for a couple of months now, but that really didn't have enoug memory to test installing The other platform (Top from now on),   so when the SunFire boxen finally arrived I took one home and another collegue installed one at the office.</p>
<p>It show that I don't care about being able to virtualise Top, one of the reasons why it took me so long to start testing was that I didn't have any media to test with and I couldn't just download a copy from the internet to start experimenting with as I`m used to with Linux.</p>
<p>I started playing with a Xen enabled FC6 instance set up some Linux instances then got a freshly burned CD from the ServiceDesk at the office and tried to boot Top ,  now what can I say.. it just worked,<br />
slow, just as I remember Top,  if the guys from Redmond say .. 10 minutes left .. you can perfectly go out for lunch Top not having finished those 10 minutes but that's just how I remember it.</p>
<pre>import os, re
arch = os.uname()<a href="/blog/4/index.html">4</a>
if re.search('64', arch):
    arch_libdir = 'lib64'
else:
    arch_libdir = 'lib'

kernel = "/usr/lib/xen/boot/hvmloader"
builder='hvm'
memory = 128
shadow_memory = 8
name = "WinDope"
vif = <a href="/blog/%27type%3dioemu%2c%20bridge%3dxenbr0%27/index.html"> 'type=ioemu, bridge=xenbr0' </a>
disk = <a href="/blog/%27file_/vhost/windows.hda%2chda%2cw%27%2c%27file_/vhost/windows/index.html"> 'file:/vhost/windows.hda,hda,w','file:/vhost/windows.cdrom,hdc:cdrom,r' </a>
device_model = '/usr/' + arch_libdir + '/xen/bin/qemu-dm'
boot="cda"
sdl=0
vnc=1
stdvga=0
serial='pty'</pre><p>Playing with sdl=0 and vnc=1 gives you the choice between direct out put on the screen or connecting via vnc remotely.<br />
Networking worked out of the box.</p>
<p>The dissapointement came when I tried doing a live migration of Top to another machine.  The linuxboxen could migrate perfectly, but Top refused.   Took me 30 seconds to figure out that<br />
that also was expected behaviour, as that feature hasn't been implemented yet and is due to be out next year .<br />
The only real problem I had with installing Top in a Xen machine was that I don't have a clue what to do with that virtual machine :)</p>
<p>Anyway the Sun Boxen go back to the other Virtualisation people at the office for them to play with.   Not sure If I`ll have time the next couple of weeks to take the MacMini back and start playing with KVM.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>So, the word is out.  A new <a href="http://www.brianberliner.com/2006/12/14/kernel-based-virtual-machine-hits-linux/">Kernel-based Virtual Machine hits Linux </a><br />
It's still unclear what Qumranet is actually doing,  but when you look at what <a href="http://linuxvirtualization.com/articles/2006/11/26/kvm-gains-save-resume-support">Moshe</a> did before Qumranet  I`m sure it's going to be great stuff !</p>
<p>It's obvious that with KVM, Xen, the work Jef Dyke is doing on kernel based hypervisors and the work Rusty is doing we need some overview to be able to spot the differences and opportunities for these different technologies.<br />
Luckily Rik Van Riel is working on a couple of interresting pages , both explaining the benefits of <a href="http://virt.kernelnewbies.org/ParavirtBenefits">paravirtualisation</a> and the different current <a href="http://virt.kernelnewbies.org/">Virtualisation Techniques on Linux</a></p>
<p>On a totally unrelated note,  If you really insist on giving me an X-Mas present for some reason , I wouldn't mind receiving something like <a href="http://lvb.net/item/4020">Luc</a> did.</p>
