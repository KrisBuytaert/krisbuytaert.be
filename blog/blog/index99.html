            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>I was in a Radisson hotel last week I experienced some strange behaviour on their access points.  I booted up my laptop and the first thing I saw was an IP collision with my default preconfigured ip and the surrounding network.  Off course there was no address already in use but upon booting I send out an arp request for my own ip address in order to figure out possible collisions.  Somehow their environment sends a positive reply back.  Strange :)</p>
<p>Next I tried to get an ip config via dhcp however failed to get an answer. Since their accesspoint replied to all my arp requests I figured out to set a random default gw.  Upon realising that they transparently captured my outging traffic it took me a while till I got redirected to their authentication page.</p>
<p>Then I ran into my next problem,  I could access hosts on ip basis but dns seemed to be completely disfunctional.  I am running my own cachnig dns server on my laptop but somehow the answers that I got back were bogus.  After configuring 2 random external dns server my luck changed.  I assume they were doing some kind of dns dns spoofing but failing to do it correctly.</p>
<p>Yet another example of you ill configured services make life much more<br />
difficult than it should be :)</p>

<p>Took ME 5 minutes , got no clue how long my computer has been working on building the actual image since I started it yesterday afternoon and didn't look  back at it till late in the evening.<br />
After deboostrap we now have tool that can build Fedora Core 2, Fedora Core 3, Fedora Core 4, Yellowdog 4, CentOS 3, CentOS 4, Mandriva and Scientific Linux systems.  Whow that's about all of the most important rpm based distros except for the Suse versions.</p>

      <div class="submitted">
          <span class="author">By: Kris Buytaert</span>
            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>When I  visited San Diego a couple of years ago I spent some time in the <a href="http://www.computer-museum.org/">San Diego Computer Museum</a> , I just learned that it is currently closed and looking for a new location, It would really be a shame if this museum whold have to close it's doors permanently.   When first visiting boston I had to learn that the computer museum that once existed there then had merged into another museum (the Mos Museum Of Science iirc) , however when visiting almost none of the expected machines could be found.   Some museums such as the Melbourne Museum  and the Powerhouse museum in Sydney still have some interresting machines on exhibit but apart from the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum in Mountain View</a> (which I've not visited yet) I haven't found any location that gives a good overview of computer history.</p>
<p>I can imagine lots of machines that are still functional and that could have an educational value hidden in some basements al over the planet (including mine).  So If anyone around is interresting in setting up a new Computer Museum in Europe/Belgium  send me a mail.. I'll probably be able to provide you with some interresting hardware  !</p>
<p>Update: just found out about the <a href="http://www.pcmuseum.ch/">PC Museum</a> in Switzerland :)) got to visit that some day :)</p>

            </div>
  <div class="content"><p><a href="http://www.ranum.com/">Marcus J Ranum</a>   of  Gauntlet, TIS and NFR fame  just published the <a href="http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/">six dumbest ideas in computer security</a>.  It's a must read for everyone !   Apart from his top 6 list Marcus also mentions some <q>minor</q> issues, such as Domain Naming System.</p>
<p>I think he missed the top dumbest idea ever,  one that tons of vendors are trying to sell you, the idea that security can be bought in a box, as product.   The idea that if you implement antivirus product such and firewall so you are safe.  It's not the fact that those products only enumerate badness, it's the fact that vendors try to make people believe that these products will solve their problems.</p>
<p>No matter how you look at it , security can't be solved by a product,  <strong>Security is an everlasting ongoing proces.</strong></p>

      <div class="submitted">
          <span class="author">By: Kris Buytaert</span>
            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>I dream of a world where a customer logs a support call,  or a ticket<br />
is created by a network monitoring tool.</p>
<p>A support engineer accepts the call and  looks at the problem.</p>
<p>(Off course the environment is fully documented in a structured way ,<br />
e.g docbook style, and one has a logbook of all the events that happened<br />
before the support call).</p>
<p>The engineer solves the call and documents his changes in the ticketing<br />
system,  these notes are automatically added to the infrastructures'<br />
changelog.</p>
<p>When an engineer has to modify substantial  amount of documentation she<br />
opens up the documentation site and start editing wiki style the<br />
documentation , or uses the plaintext version that she has checked out<br />
of a repository and commits it back afterwards.</p>
<p>Upon closing a call the customer gets an automatically generated update<br />
of his documentation (generated in .rtf / .pdf or online)"</p>
<p>Uff course the engineer only has 1 place where he/she should point a<br />
browser to .</p>
<p>I don't think it's that far away .. however someone needs to integrate these tools</p>
<p>In case you're wondering which tools</p>

  <div class="content"><p>I`m struggling with a bad adsl connection latelty.  So bad that my connection often dies for hours,  It's supposed to be my internal telephone line which I've replaced by now so I`m hoping for the best.</p>
<p>Anyway .. we had short power outage yesterday night and my iMac (running ubuntu) got rebooted.  When trying to log in, the screen went brown and nothing else happened.<br />
Strange.. didn't see any errors in the logs , when switching to console mode one error catched my eye,  some files couldn't be untarred because they were in the future.<br />
While looking at the permissions of files in /tmp where  gnome etc tend to throw some files , I noticed that a lot of files were dated 1 january 1904 (yes that's right 1904 !!).<br />
Which meant that ntpdate had failed,  it couldn't look up the hostname for it's ntp server  (in this case because I had no ip connectivity).</p>
<p>So because a <strong>DNS lookup failed I</strong> could not log on to my desktop..</p>
