  <div class="content"><p>In <a href="http://asay.blogspot.com/2006/08/open-source-location-redux.html">Open source location redux</a>  Matt wonders if he should add more sales infrastructure in Europe or less.</p>
<blockquote><p>(Having said that, Alfresco has realized an immediate gain from adding sales/business development people in Germany and France. Suddenly, many downloads that had been inclined toward a free beer discovered the value of paying for freedom. So maybe the real solution to the "problem" is to invest more sales infrastructure in Europe, rather than less? Not sure....)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the obvious answer is to in invest <em>smarter</em></p>
<p>As an open source company , Alfresco luckily was one of the firsts to realise that the only way to conquer the European market is to be present there locally.</p>
<p>RedHat  and MySQL learned this slowly,  it took years before customers could match a face to RedHat and even longer to to feel local presence. A European customer does not buy easily from  some sales office in the UK if it's only a sales office,  they want to talk to someone.  Timezones and language differences make it even more difficult.   Lots of people want to work with  someone in their timezone who speaks their language and their culture (Sometimes even their dialect,  as from experience I know that a Dutch salesguy isn't likely to sell much in Belgium)</p>
<p>As for Open Source startups it's impossible to do such an investment  so they need to find good partners for local support.  Being based in the USA is easy.. you have a vast amount of customers living in the same country speaking the same language.</p>
<p>But here's your next question ..<br />
"How should an open source company choose it's partners ? , based on revenue  from reselling products  or based on finding soulmates with skills to support and contribute to their products ?"</p>

      <div class="submitted">
          <span class="author">By: Kris Buytaert</span>
            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>I was looking for an alternative to MySQL Cluster  for large tables, less critical tables but still important enough ones ;)</p>
<p>I got MySQL cluster up and running for most of my tables,  but we need some tables that are storing log information,  it's not really critical, but we don't want to loose it anyway.  As we don't want to put that stuf in memory I was looking into replication those tables.  Now Linux-HA  takes care of which mysqld instance to talk to ,  but if I fail over the active database IP  the applications start writing to the 2nd node which is the replication slave for a couple of tables. That's perfect for the Cluster tables, but it's pain for the replicated InnodB tables as replication breaks and I can't migrate back automagically.</p>
<p>Upon reading the  --read-only  parameter in the replication documentation I tought I had found the solution, only to realise this actually puts the whole mysql in read-only also the tables being used by MySQL Cluster,  not a good  solution either therefore.</p>
<p>Fiddling with different users on the different nodes having diffent permissions crossed my mind , but then I started thinking about creating a set of 3 tables.   A .master table, a .slave table and on both nodes a .merge table of the previous ones.  Read access would be to the .merge table, write access to the .master table, while  using --replicate-rewrite-db  to replicate to the .slave table.  It could have worked (didn't try) but my tables were InnoDB.<br />
I went ahead anyway and setup cross replication for both nodes to another database.      Both nodes now have databases with the same tables<br />
blah and blahrepl  as this is log information I can always manually merge when I need the data , but at least I don't lose it when a node crashes.</p>
<p>One tricky thing however .. it's documented in the comments of the mysql site</p>
<blockquote><p>If you're attempting to use both<br />
replicate-do-db=from_name<br />
and<br />
replicate-rewrite-db=from_name-&gt;to_name<br />
be aware that you need to actually say<br />
replicate-do-db=to_name<br />
because the rewrite rule apparently happens before<br />
the do-db rule.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that works.</p>
<p>I  should look into upgrading those boxen to  MySQL 5.1.11  and continue my tests on  Disk Based Cluster ,  but as they are on an older platform with no prebuild rpm's available that wasn't an option today ..</p>

  <div class="content"><p>You know you can't just boot Xen of a PXE server, it's not a normal linuxkernel your booting , so you need<br />
a multibootloader, such as the COM32 one that is packed in recent syslinux versions.</p>
<p>While playing with openQRM I ran into an odd problem.  I still haven't figured out the actual problem.</p>
<p>I saw  COM32 Multibootloader v0.1 taking a Xen from boot/xen.gz<br />
then the module  boot/res-1-kernel  and later boot/res-1-initrd.img ...<br />
after loading the last one and about 2.5 lines of dots I got<br />
Booting:  MBI=0x000100d8, entry=0x00100000</p>
<p>Then nothing and it seemed like my machine locked.</p>
<p>The fix was to upgrade the multibootloader to the one that is in Syslinux 3.11  from there on.. no more problems.</p>

well.. maybe not all the talks but at least the people :)   Conference is booked,  Hotel is  booked,  Ride back booked , still figuring out how to get there. Why can you get a travel itinary on <a href="http://www.nmbs.be/">www.nmbs.be</a> but no pricing, not even an estimate ?</p>
<p>The schedule for LinuxWorldExpo.nl is also online, if you can call it a schedule .. well.. it has  Harald,  Georg .. some other people .. and me ..<br />
But before that .. Barcamp Brussels.   this time I`m gonna try to be on time and try to present something :)</p>

      <div class="submitted">

            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>In <a href="http://madstop.com/articles/2006/07/31/an-open-letter-to-tim-bray-about-oscon">An Open Letter to Tim Bray about OSCON</a><br />
documents his experience at OSCON.</p>
<p>I`'ve already commented earlier on different conferences and I feel his pain,  some conferences don't fit your expectations because the target audience is different than you expected.     Sometimes it's like talking about Single System Image clustering to a bunch of people that have just installed their first Linux box at home, other times it's like talking about the difficulty of configuring someones desktop preferences to a bunch of kernel developers,   There's a good chance they don't care since they already know how to do that :)</p>
<p>However for me a talk was worth the effort if there was at least 1 person in the audience who learned something,  If I can convince 1 (one) person in the audience to have a look at a project,  to think about how he is working today and get feedback from him, it was worth the effort.     And it's true that different areas of the opensource world should try to take a closer look at eachother, visit eachothers events and learn.  You're never too old :)<br />
So I`m sure that there was at least one guy in the audience who learned about Puppet and will start looking deeper into it.</p>
<p>Actually remembering  LISA 05 ,  I submitted some Xen  abstracts and didn't get accepted, only to have lots' of people complain why there was not one single Xen talk,  so it seemed there were some issues on that conference program there too :)   Actually I still didn't get any feedback on my abstracts on Xen deployments for this years edition.</p>
<p>So before the schedule is out lemme say this . imvho  at this year's LISA there should at least be a talk on openQRM and some talks on deploying Virtual Machines. :)</p>
<p>Anyway .. the important part isn't even  trying  to interrest different kinds of people in your project , it's meeting them , it's hearing different opinions on how to do stuff and their reasons for doing so , It's learing  from them , wether it's on kernel level, infrastructure level, or development level :)</p>

tels us what we already know for a decade.  We have to move forward to build infrastructures that can survive the 10th floor test.</p>
<blockquote><p>Moving this process to the field of system administration, I would expect that a test system is rebuilt nightly unattended from scratch using the operating system distribution files, appropriate scripts, and add-on packages. All needed elements would be stored on local file servers under a configuration management system like CVS. Such a practice obviates the all too common danger of having a running system depending on a tool that was once fetched over the net from a site that has ceased to exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think comparing it to nightly builds is a good thing.. afteral on our development platforms we are aiming for nightly redeployments :)</p>
