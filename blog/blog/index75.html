<blockquote><p>A conversation with a friend today made me wonder, "What will Novell buy?" Word on the street is that the company has $200M or so burning a hole in its pocket, with Altiris and XenSource as potential acquisition candidates. If there's any fire behind the smoke, both deals could make sense, albeit for very different reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder,  does XenSource want to be bought ?   When talking to Peter Levine in Amsterdam  early december I wasn't under the impression they were interrested in being bought any time soon , if you look at his previous track record at Veritas I think he's someone who wants to build something big,  not sell something small.</p>

<p>I want to talk to you about the new features in your next generation Car Radios ,  I have a favorite <a href="http://www.stubru.be/">channel</a>, but sometimes they play music that I really can't tolerate,  I then switch to my CD player, usually forgetting to switch back for the rest of the trip.  Hence missing all the other good songs I appreciate listening to.</p>
<p>What I want from you is 1 button.  A button I push whey I don't like the music that is being played  , there should be some way to tell upfront how long a song wil last , and you pick a random number of about the same length play it and then return control back to the radio station. Ideally offcourse you have multiple tracks, and you learn which kind of music I hate and never play it again.  <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> already does that for me online.</p>
<p>So what's keeping you.  I`m happy to test those features for you !</p>

      <div class="submitted">
          <span class="author">By: Kris Buytaert</span>
            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>I already touched the topic  in the previous article,  but I've been wondering,  how do you ideally manage say Perl or PHP code in a Large Environment.<br />
As earlier noted     I want a system to be    reproducability under    version control and I want to be able to identify the source of every single file on my system either as belonging to a package or being transferred there from my version control platform.</p>
<p>For the ease of reading let's say we stick to mass deploying PHP Code.      Libraries most certainly belong to be in packages.  One can disuss where your own code belings.<br />
sTypically PHP code, html layout and Stylesheets are small files that are modified manually by a developer .  Often really small changes are being made to those files.<br />
These changes don't need to be recompiled in order to be used so shops that use this kind of code don't always have tradition of build and release management.</p>
<p>I`m thinking about abusing configuration management tools to manage code and just consider code as a configuration file.<br />
Amongst the disadvantages of using these file based management tools , puppet/cfengine/yourpoison but it should be a tool that makes it as easy for you to update 1 file on 1 machine as 1 file on 2000 machines.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unclear file origin , you have no direct link anymore between the file and where it came from on the machine as it doesn't show up in a package list and rpm -qf doesn't  help you either</li>
<li>You need a  tool , most people these days know either rpm or dpkg , either  apt or yum, using  a tool such as CFengine or Puppet makes it  more complex for new people to step in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DisAdvantages of packaging code</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a less granular way of defining which files need to be modified,  it's an all or nothing approach , however you can define how small your packages  are</li>
<li>You need a build framework to build the packages, off course this can be automated.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use tagging wisely you're sure that either way you know which version is on the production platform.<br />
Most configuration management systems have features that allow you to verify if a file is changed or to to do a certain action after you update this so that's not an issue.<br />
Is using a  package per application really that much overhead ?   If you already have the infrastructure in place to build your packages then what's the extra effort ?</p>
<p>I've used both approaches so far,  a lot depends on the culture of the developers team and the already existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>So what's your opinion ?</p>

      <div class="submitted">
          <span class="author">By: Kris Buytaert</span>
            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>I must be so out of IBM's target audience with regard to their <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/osource/implement.html">Drupal Hosting</a> article <a href="http://buytaert.net/ibm-on-hosting-drupal-sites">Dries</a> pointed us to.</p>
<p>Lemme say that again,  I was probably not their target audience !   so my opinion on  the article isn't really relevant. But still, here's what bothers me in the article.</p>
<p>The article explains how to  create a virtual machine with Drupal and how to deploy it later in a webhosting infrastructure.  A very good idea, however the way they explain the user how to do it will lead to problems when one eventually wants to scale further. Some basic rules of Large Scale deployment have been forgotten (but as told that was not the audience).   Nowhere in the article is reproducability or scalability mentionned.</p>
<p>Early in the article I read that they were disappointed they couldn't use Xen because the management tools were not as polished and robust as they would like.<br />
They couldn't save enough time by using Xen but had enough time to create a zillion screenshots from a gui ?     For me managability means that I can script everything and I don't need a GUI. Actually  having to use a gui to configure stuff means it's NOT manageable at all.   Certainly when going to Large Scale installs. Imaging having to  click 100 times on a start button, that just doesn't scale.</p>
<p>But not all is bad in the article Using LVM is good , very good,  Using CVS good &amp; taggin good , checking out CVS from the production server,   not really good .<br />
As long as you have 1 server it's fine, but as soon as you have more servers you will one day have a developer fixing a bug on machine 1 , even comitting it, but it never gets deployed to machine 2,3 and 4.   So it's a good habit not to allow it for starters  as old habits die hard :)</p>
<p>One should have a mechanism in place that pushes new updates to the servers, or have the servers periodically pull the update, which brings me to another topic,  should I package parsable code , or should I keep the files in a repository file by file and have method to transfer those.    Hmm.. that's stuff for a different posting.</p>
<p>Next up is a really bad habit.  It's all the dissadvantages of transferring full disk image vs recreating that same image in a different machine.  It's the VMWare idea of deploying, just copy a big file to another disk and start the virtual machine there.  Good, for testing, demos etc.. but not for large scale deployment  Use real LVM on the machine and deploy there , reproducable.<br />
The biggest problem with transferring disk is that  you never now how you got there , and you'll never be able to reproduce what you did .<br />
<a href="http://howto.x-tend.be/AutomatingVirtualMachineDeployment/">My paper </a> on Automating Virtual Machine Deployment explains how you can do this, mind the methodology, not the tools.<br />
It doesn't matter if you use Fai, Kickstart or SystemImager ,  but USE them !</p>
<p>This article is a  a good start for developers,  but it's a No Go for an experienced system admin.  Working like this just doesn't scale.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Most people blog about the new year in their first article.   Seems like I already posted stuff earlier this year</p>
<p>First of all.. I`m wondering  If spam has been slowing down the last couple of weeks (oops shouldn't have asked probably)  nevertheless<br />
I`m about to close down a couple of old email accounts,  I`m in the process of moving away some old mailinglist to more relevant accounts and I`m still in some suppliers databases with really old addresses.  But still will we ever find a way to punish a spammer good enough so that he stops spamming.  The sad thing is that there are probably too much idiots out there that buy stuff from spammers , otherwise spam would have died ages ago.  So the real question is, how do we prevent braindead people from using the internet.</p>
<p>Some people think it's time for a new internet,  an internet where only people that know how to manage their machines are allowed, a network that can't be poisoned by zombie machines becasue noone will be allowed to connect a machine that could go zombie.  Will it ever happen ?</p>
<p>As usual 2007 will be a big year for lots of people,  zillion of startups out there that really need to make some money now<br />
Each year is always a big year for someone :)  A couple of people told me last year that 2007 was going to be the year <em>they</em> were going to start up a new company.   You know who you are,  I wish you all the luck with your new efforts.    And for all the others .. keep going !</p>
