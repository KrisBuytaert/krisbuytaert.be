            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>As you can see I`m lagging on blog postings , there is still lost of stuff I want to talk about but I fail to find enough time to write down my ideas.  Almost 2 weeks ago the NLUUG Spring conference was held in Ede,  this years topic was Virtualisation.  As mentionned earlier I was invited to talk about Using openQRM to manage Virtual Machines, with Xen in particular.</p>
<p>The day started with <a href="http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/">Joanna Rutkowska</a> talking about Blue Pill the conecpt of moving a running operating system un the fly into a virtual machine, and the impact on security for these machines.  She started off with a fairly technical talk which I`m sure that not everybody in the audience understood, so gi<br />
ven the early hour lots of them dozed off..  Too bad the occasional security joke was only noticed by few :(</p>
<p>The next talk was the one from Vitaly Wool who got swapped with the one from Frank Weyns,  As a former MontaVista employee Vitaly dicussed the reasons for userland drivers in an embedded environment.  If you think about the fact that different mobile phones today still are running different operating systems on different cpu's , think what virtualisation in this area could do.</p>
<p>After my own talk and the Lunch break Anil Madhavapeddy was up to give us an update on the current state of Xen<br />
Anil at that time he told us that 3.0.5 could happen any time now.. which in the meanwhile has happened in the form of 3.1 The weird thing is that every time I see Anil giving a talk he has a new release ready :)<br />
Maybe I should meet with him more often :)<br />
He also gave us an overview of the interresting stuff that had just happened at the XenSummit and information on the Xen Roadmap</p>
<p>Obviously I staid in the maintrack to see Avi Kivity present his work on KVM, I'd probably have come to this confere<br />
nce as a visitor just to see this talk if I hadn't been a speaker.</p>
<p>I Skipped Franks and the BSD talk, then tried to sneak into the Using Xen talk but it was so crowded and from the hallpath I could see there wasn't going to be much to be learned for me.</p>
<p>Asia Slowinska  closed the day with a talk on Prospector, or how she used Qemu based virtual machines to analyse Sta<br />
ck Overflows,  fairly interresting stuff .</p>
<p>Tim and I wondered "Do you have to be female in order to be interrested in both Virtualisation and Security ?"<br />
I haven't seen that many women giving such technical talks at conferences,  this was something totally different fro<br />
m Creating new tracks in TuxRacer. (which also was a great talk btw)</p>
<p>The Drink after the conference had a nice surprise for me.  There was a contest which Tim Hemel and I seemed to had won where Tim got an MP3 player and I got a Linksys WRT54GL.  More about that new toy in a later post.</p>
<p>As I didn't want to get stuck in traffic hungry I had gladly  accepted to join the rest of the speakers for the conference dinner.  I`m not used to quality food in the Netherland so I wasn't expecting much but I was quite surprised with the quality of "Het Oude Politiebureau" in Ede.</p>
<p>Anyway the Virtualisation conference was some time well spent !</p>

            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>The <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampBrussels3">3rd Barcamp Brussels</a> is over,  I was a bit dissapointed over the target audience of the first Barcamp,  missed the second one, but the 3rd one was right where I expected it to be<br />
A healthy mix of technology,  startup projects and the social aspect of technology.</p>
<p>I took my <a href="http://www.tuxisalive.com/">Tuxdroid</a>  with me, planned on having him tell the audience what they were <a href="http://twitter.com/barcampbrussels">twittering</a> about, the idea was to take the logfile of my twitter jabber session and feed that to the text to speech deamon into Tux.  I failed due to the lack of network hence incoming twitter stream,  however the Tuxdroid proudly whacked its wings at the end of each talk :)</p>
<p>So about those talks :)</p>
<p>After <a href="http://blog.forret.com/">Peter</a> gave the startshot for the fight for a slot to talk I went to see the talk about <a href="http://www.gegis.org/">gegis</a> by  Dirk  Frigne.<br />
I totally didn't know there was an OpenSource project written for the Belgian governement which was into Gis .. cool stuff to see.</p>
<p><a href="http://frank.be/">Frank</a> then was next with his talk about <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>, I really should spend time with openid, hmm.. I kind of think I`m repeating myselve :)<br />
Then <a href="http://wonko.be/">Bernard</a> continued with his talk on Performance of webb applications which off course included a large part about Databases..<br />
I need to delete lots of stuff from my presentation :)</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.johnbaeyens.com/">John</a> introduced us to <a href="http://blog.notsoso.com/">NotSoso</a>,  now if only I could find some spare minutes to actually look into NotSoso,  I guess that that will be for later this week, or even after the weekend.</p>
<p>Then we had a 2 hour break for lunch and a groupfoto by <a href="http://blog.pictrix.be/">Steven</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.blogologie.be/">Maarten</a> did a talk about the <a href="http://www.blogoloog.be/">Blogoloog</a> and how he started out with an old Laptop with Fedora Core and now evolved into something more suitable , and <a href="http://www.vandenabeele.com/">Peter</a> explained us about <a href="http://www.taximize.be/">Belgian Tax Law</a> .</p>
<p>Then some people found me interresting enough to come and listen to <a href="http://www.x-tend.be/~kb/blog/index.php?2007/05/05/369-barcamp-brussels-mysql-presentation">my talk about MySQL Cluster</a>,  I actually had taken the talk I had been preparing for the MySQL Symposium that should have taken place in<br />
Amsterdam earlier this year and got cancelled.  That talk supposed to be over 2 hours.  So I kind of cut over 70% of the slides I had tried fitting them into a 20 minute talk.<br />
I kind of "managed" :)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ondernemeringent.be/">Bart</a> gave an interresting talk about your online reputation, how to screw it and how to protect it.  An interresting topic came up,  should you poison your blog to attract a different audience ?  Because according to him  your peers are probably not your customers and you should try to get new potential customers to know you .  So with that in mind.. what should I start blogging about ?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bnox.be/">Clo</a> and Bart Becks held a "Powerpoint Karaoke" on how to create a Sect, <a href="http://pietel.be/">Pietel</a> managed to take pictures that suggested that everybody actually joined the sect, that certainly wasn't true !<br />
After It's in the details by<a href="http://www.bornontheweb.be/"> Jesse</a> and an even more interresting talk about what we could do with <a href="http://hamstersoup.wordpress.com/2007/05/05/barcamp-brussels-my-freebase-talk/">Freebase  by Will</a>   I headed home exhausted, but satisfied.</p>
<p>I`m sure I missed some other interresting talks like the one from Toon Vanagt about <a href="http://www.transferitonline.com/">TransferItOnline</a> but other events will come where I can meet and talk to those people again !</p>

      <div class="submitted">
          <span class="author">By: Kris Buytaert</span>
            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>So this company which doesn't deserve to be mentionned by name here really pissed me off last week.  I`m already fed up with the different email spams I get from them on, apart from that lots of people try to phish me into giving away my unexisting username and password for that company  ,but last week they really went over the line.  The send a big package to my office address with some papers in it and some rubbish.</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that I never asked for their spam they were so stupid to send it in the wrong language.  Yes they send me their rubbish in French,  now I have no problem with people sending me stuff in English, but if you want to localise please do it correct,  Belgium has 3 official languages,  and my native language is not French !   So most often you're better of sending stuff in English.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the Novell, "We speak your language" campaign, maybe the same spam database has been used , as with the Novell campaign about 3 years ago I also was addressed in the wrong language.</p>
<p>Now to top the annoyancy the sent a usefull headset with their package, it would have been the only part from the package that didn't live in the trashbin yet if it would have survived the 20 minute car trip in my laptop bag to a customer.   It didn't.</p>
<p>So to all you stupid marketeers, here are some valuable lessons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't spam me,</li>
<li>Address me in my own language or English ,</li>
<li>If you send me gadgets, presents, make sure they don't break before I can actually use them.</li>

<p>ZDNet asks  "<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=1036">Will the last top developer out of Novell please turn off the lights? </a>"  ,<br />
I really hope that Novell will realise they are heading in the wrong direction and take the right conclusions soon.  Lots of important people have left Novell such as Jeremy,  Robert Love, Gerd Hoffmann and others.  I hope they got the hint and realise that in order to be one of the important Open Source companies, you actually need to have Open Source people work for you .. and not only marketing and sales people.</p>

  <div class="content"><p>So google is plannnig to open a googleplex in Belgium, I`m still not sure if I like this or not.<br />
My first reaction was that this is not good for the local startups and entrepreneurs as they won't be able to find highly skilled techies, as they would all be wanting to work for the big G.  Well, not all of them but still.</p>
<pre></pre><p>When discussing that idea with Bob Young last week Bob gave me another look at the situation,  Google will attract some of the brighter people in Europe and not all of them will like the culture there, which probably has changed over the years,  some people won't fit in the strict Google organisation and create a whole new group of people that have moved into the area with their own ideas and skills.</p>
<p>There is one thing that doesn't fit here however and that's the language factor  :(<br />
But for developers and on the web that doesn't really matter,  for local consultancy however it does.</p>
