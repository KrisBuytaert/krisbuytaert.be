<p>I initially toughtt it was Thomas Lange who invented the term (as told to me on #fai) but it seems he got it from Steve.</p>

<p>
Ok so I`m not planning on making money with it ,  but as people keep missing the point , it is time for a broader campaing to spread the word :
</p>
<p><center>Everything is a freaking  DNS Problem</center></p>
<p>no really, it is .. and if it's not well...we have a list of other issues that might cause your problems but they are only worth looking at , AFTER we excluded the DNS issues.<br />
So get those T-Shirts, and wear them as much as you can so that each time someone starts complaining about his slow ssh access to a machine, you just have to point him to the text on your chest.<br />
After a while they'll realise your right :)
</p>
<p><font size="-2">BTW: I  only bought the original black &amp; white T-Shirt with Text so far,  but the quality seems really good so I hope the same for the other designs.</font></p>

  <div class="content"><p>Everybody knows that the average human brain isn't designed to be able to memorise all possible facts, phonenumbers, passwords, tips, tricks , command line options etc etc, so keeping stuff stored somewhere o n a safe location might be a wise thing to do<br />
<a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7567">Living In Text Files</a> might be a good idea at first but I prefer to live in a structured Text  text file.</p>
<p>A structured text file (such as a <a href="../www.docbook/index.html">docbook</a> based xml or even sgml document) gives you a couple of extra benefits.<br />
I structure my notes a chapter a day,  then subsections for eacht topic I`m working on.</p>
<p>What I  get back is an unlimted ammount of data that I will need afterwards.  From my day to day notes I can easily build project documentation , I can grep trough my docs for important strings , and If  I really don't know what string to look for I can at least go have a look based on the date I wrote it.. Mostly I have some idea when I did something.</p>
<p>The key thing is to document everything, from command line options you don't frequently use to errors in log files and how you solved them.<br />
From meeting minutes to failure in things you tried.  Trial and error needs to be documented in order not to make the same errors again :)</p>
<p>So Yes I Live in Text files, even a couple of big ones  but they are structured</p>

  <div class="content"><p>A  small  bit of chaos since the building where the talks were<br />
yesterday was closed, no signs or anything so after talking to some<br />
people I figured out they moved to the basement of another building</p>
<p>The FAI talk , I`m interrested how this differs from SystemImager<br />
etc , Thomas Lange even mentions infrastructures.org a couple of<br />
times. He also mentions the only good way when using imaging (golden<br />
image etc) is when you automatically build the image (with FAI) ,<br />
what can I say more.. (GMTA? :)) Off course I build the images<br />
either with systeminstaller ,deboostrap or yum (--install=$PATH -y groupinstall Base Apart from installing Thomas explains how he<br />
modifies config files using CFengine , he also mentions that you<br />
should be using cfengine to modify existing config files but not create config files with them.</p>
<p>Thomas mentions future RPM distro support based on smartpm No Xen integration yet :) Sometimes talks are great, not because you learn something but because they totally confirm that the way you are doing things is the good way to do it.</p>
<p>Hands off , on the other way of automating Debian installs , Philip explains  he needed a way to install Debian for people with no infrastructure, (people with no (reverse) dns knowledge etc)</p>
<p>It  seems  that linux.conf.au started with a tradition that is spreading to the rest of the planet now, last conference day lunch == pizza fight.<br />
As we have to be back in Dover at a reasonable hour I`ll be skipping the last talks in order to be able to check out or the hotel :)</p>
<p>Looking back the UKUUG Conference is one of the more interresting conferences around ,  a nice location combined with interresting topics , Alasdair did a great job organising the event, thnx a lot !</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Ian Pratt , Xen, a full 1.5 hour talk about Xen</p>
<p>Ian mentions lots of uses for Xen : Consolidate, Avoid Downtime ,<br />
Dynamically re-balance workload to guarantee application SLA's and Enforce security policy</p>
<p>Multilevel secure systems , 1 virtual machine for browsing (back at home) , 1 virtual machine for corporate usage which can securely<br />
connect back to the office.</p>
<p>The Xen 3.0 release is between 4 to 6 week away and will support new architectures Xen is moving stuff out of xen and let Linux do that<br />
stuff  for  them, this way they can start using ACPI and AGP ,initially Xen was developed as a Server back end which means that<br />
back then people didn't need X and ACPI, this will now change.</p>
<p>SMP virtual machines are now possible, (or how to fake a 32 CPU machine on a single CPU machine ..) Support for the new Intel VTx<br />
extensions which will enable them to run proprietary platforms is also on the roadmap.</p>
<p>Marcus Hardt shows us some Use cases for Xen, since he doesn't get the budget to buy enough machines when teaching HPC he uses Xen to build a Grid in a box. He's also providing people with a Login Cluster  which gives people an on demand distro based on their username</p>
<p>Marcus  then  went  on  to  discuss  the  Benchmarking he with <a href="http://www.freebench.org/" title="www.Freebench.org">www.Freebench.org</a> tools regarding Xen.<br />
Ruediger Berlich explained what a grid really is (unlike Oracle's wannabe grid stuff) and how the EGEE project tries to solve the problem  of  different grid projects not being compatible with eachother by creating and operating a production grid and supporting the end -users by building gLite on top of best of breed of other  grid projects.</p>
<p>After lunch I squeezed down my laptops resolution to 640x480 and gave a fast forward openMosix presentation, the 10 minutes left sign really came way to fast, which made me skip a couple of slides and probably made the talk even more chaoitic than it already is :( It probably also made the talk look like I didn't say anything more than the stuff already on the slides which was obviously not the goal.</p>
<p>Dropped back into the Linux on Power talk by Nigel, who pointed us to what he thinks is a better way of displaying/reporting system information<br />
<a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/eserver/articles/analyze_aix/">http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/eserver/articles/analyze_aix/</a></p>
<p>Back to the hotel to get some food and sleep :)</p>

            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>I first went to the "Experiences of a large linux deployment in<br />
education." talk of which the title already got changed to "a linux<br />
deployment",  no  sign  of  the large part :( Which was rather<br />
dissapointing for me. However the talk was interesting anyway. They<br />
mainly discussed thin client solutions using LTSP. With 1 server<br />
they serve about 35 users. (dual cpu 4Gb) Using blade servers (IBM)<br />
only for standardisation reasons.</p>
<p>They had a relevant complaint about Memory utilisation of both<br />
OpenOffice,  Gnome  and  KDE, where's the time when we squezed everything into 4Kb :)</p>
<p>Moving to adopting a driver where Matthew Wilcox explained how you<br />
can end up maintaining a subsystem and called for more volunteers :)</p>
<p>Linux and ACPI, a brave new world of power management, a good and<br />
detailed explanation of why ACPI is so difficult, where's the time<br />
that VGA mode was really VGA mode (just set a couple of registers and int 13h right ? )</p>
<p>System Tap, rerun of an OLS 2005 talk , it introduces a new tool to<br />
diagnose complex system problem while not having to rebuild / reboot<br />
your environment too much. It's based on the kprobes infrastructure<br />
and not only aimed at kernel developers alone ;)</p>
<p>Lunch, great lunch, som curries with rice, nice .. reminds me of the<br />
Lunches at LinuxKongress and the Pizza party at LCA.</p>
<p>BSD Talk about Mitigating Security , somehow this reminds me of the<br />
RedHat security talk at Fudconf 2005 Linux, well, at least some of<br />
the parts do :)</p>
<p>Missed Bdale's talk at linux.conf.au .. and now I finally know what<br />
bouncing of the moon is :) The most interresting part of the talk is<br />
the  reason why people have been working so hard on gnu radio,<br />
because  this way they prevent legislation to disallow them to<br />
reverse engineer hdtv since there already is an open source version   available that can display it.</p>
<p>On to OpenStreetMap.com , Steve Coast claims to be the new Wikipedia<br />
for but then for Maps, just as wikipedia was after their first year<br />
they have a good starting point that contains some usefull maps and<br />
with the help of the community it will grow, maybe I should hook up a GPS to my car and start feeding them some info. We need more<br />
detailed freely available maps of Antwerp and surroundings :)</p>
<p>Napi talk from Jamal Hadi Salim , with some benchmarking regardingNapi.</p>
<p>Now am I asleep or did I just see Christoph having to use Jamals<br />
laptop cause his Powerbook doesn't wan't to work on the projector ?<br />
Anyway we can sleep safe since Christoph just confirmed that he is<br />
not a spy working for Sco (anymore):)</p>
<p>Seems like a hughe amount of presentations are having problems with<br />
the projectors ;( There is some urgent need for people to fix this.</p>
<p>After the Conference Dinner, we had Dave Miller giving the Keynote ,<br />
he gave a nice overview of Netconf, on who is doing what, what we'll<br />
see in the new kernels. I've got no notes as I was trying to make sure Dave didn't fall over my feet while giving his talk, and I<br />
usually don't run around with my laptop at conference dinners :)</p>
