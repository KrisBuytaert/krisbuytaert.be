Since the 2.4.26-om2 release wasn't building on that platform anymore I had to recreated a new old build machine with RH9.<br />

  <div class="content"><p>I`m slowly settling in my new home office. the paint is dry since  about 5 months now , the rack is fully operational and my cluster test environment is almost up and running.<br />
My <a href="http://www.tuxscreen.net/">TuxScreen</a> is finally being used for what it was designed, making phonecalls.  And my <a href="http://www.lowendmac.com/imacs/blue.shtml">Imac</a> has been turned into an <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu</a> machine.  But  I needed some new equipment ,  Jacke could spare me an old Cisco 2945 swich that could replacy my old 16 port 10Mb hub and another temporary 8port 100Mb switch and he also had a spare KVM.<br />
Altough I`m used working with a 2950 on my desk at the office, having a 2945 in my rack at home is different, it makes a hell of a noise.  I`m wondering if I can just pull out 3 of the 4 fans in there , anyone experience on that ?</p>
<p>I've also finally ordered my new HTPC machine,  should be arriving next week, more fun time coming up.</p>
<p>At the office our <a href="http://www.digium.com/index.php?menu=product_detail&amp;category=hardware&amp;product=DEVKIT">Asterix Developers Kit</a>  has also arrived , so  more fun time there also :0</p>

common causes for TCP performance problems, are<br />
<em>Too small TCP window size;  Fast Ethernet duplex mismatch; Bad patch cable.</em><br />
If those those 3 togehter really  are responsible for about 80% of the TCP performance problems it's an - educated guess, going out  on a limp here - that as the other 20% will be fscking dns problems we will shortly solve all the tcp/ip related  network problems around.  Still we'll have to solve al the UDP  problems. :)))</p>

            </div>
  <div class="content"><p>I just got the strangest phonecall,  An older woman (I guess) looking for contact information , a phonenumber of one of my old bosses (Rudy Hageman).<br />
Apart from the fact that I used to be listed as dns contact for RealSoftware nothing could actually lead to my mobile phone number as the primary point of contact.</p>
<p>She first asked me if I knew him , off course , but I haven't seen the man since I left his company about 5 year ago. Then she asked if I had his phone number , but even if I had one it would have been an old one.   I suggested she called 1207 to get  his phonenumber telling her she should look around Edegem/Kontich since that where he lived.  I know his private address but I wasn't going to give that to anyone.  She then asked me If I could give her contact information for RealSoftware,  I replied that since he doesn't work there anymore , she should rather try to contact him at his new company.</p>
<p>She was surprised that I knew all those things,  to me they were general knowledge, everyone who follows our local IT economy even from a large distance knows these things.  Anyway I told her the name of the new company and  had a look at it's homepage while spelling it.   And guess what I found in the contact section .. exactly , a mobile phone number and an address.   I made a woman really really happy :)  Little does she know that I now have her name,  address , phonenumber</p>
<p>Wasted 2 minutes of my time, and had a good laugh afterwards Afterall, it probably was just a fscking DNS problem :)</p>

<a href="http://members.chello.be/cr26864/">Geert Compu Uytterhoeven</a> who are both  active in different area's of kerneldevelopment</p>

<p>Destkop wise we have  both <a href="http://thomas.apestaart.org/log/">Gstreamer</a> and  <a href="http://www.seconix.com/wordpress/">Gnomemeeting</a></p>
<p><a href="http://bofh.be/clusterknoppix/">Clusterknoppix</a> was made in Leuven and is the nr 1 openMosix instant Cluster CD around.</p>
<p>Early work on porting <a href="http://blackdown.org/java-linux/java-linux-contact.html">Java to Linux</a> was indeed done by people that live in our country<br />
I haven't even started mentionning all of the other Java stuff , that would probably take me at least a  week to list everything :)</p>
<p>Last one for today is the world's favourite LDAP Gui, <a href="http://biot.com/gq">GQ</a> was even menttionned by Tridge it during his <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">LCA2005</a> talk .</p>
<p>I only spend 5 minutes writing this down .. so I really must have missed a lot of them :)<br />
Do you know others ?</p>
