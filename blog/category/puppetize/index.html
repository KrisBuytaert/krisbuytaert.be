  <div class="content"><p>and with that almost a full week of side events.<br />
For those who don't know FOSDEM, (where have you been hiding for the past 13 years ? )  Fosdem is the annual Free and Open Source Developers European meeting. If you are into open source , you just can't mis this event where thousands of likeminded people will meet.</p>
<p>And if 2 days of FOSDEM madness isn't enough people organise events around it.</p>
<p>Last year I organised PuppetCamp in Gent, the days before Fosdem and a MonitoringLove Hackfest in our office the 2 days after FOSDEM This year another marathon is planned.</p>
<p>On Friday (31/1/2014) the CentOs community is hosting a <a href="http://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Brussels2014" rel="nofollow">Dojo in Brussels</a> at the IBM Forum. (Free, but registration required by the venue)</p>
<p>After the success of PuppetCamp in Gent last year we decided to open up the discussion and get more Infrastructure as Code people involved in a <a href="http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu/" rel="nofollow">CfgMgmtCamp.eu</a>  </p>
<p>The keynotes for CfgMgmtCamp will include the leaders of the 3 most popular tools around ,  both Mark Burgess, Luke Kanies and Adam Jacob will present at the event which will take place in Gent  right after Fosdem.  We expect people from all the major communities including, but not limited to , Ansible, Salt, Chef, Puppet, CFengine, Rudder, Foreman and Juju (Free but registration required for catering)</p>
<p>And because 3 events in one week isn't enough the RedHat Community is hosting their <a href="http://community.redhat.com/blog/2013/12/announcing-infrastructure-next/" rel="nofollow">Infrastructure.next</a> conference after CfgMgmtCamp at the same venue.  (Free but registration required for catering)</p>
<p>cya in Belgium next year..</p>

</ul></span>
        </div>
  <div class="content"><p>(aka the opinionated summary of the #devopsdays London November OpenSpace on  , Containers and the new flood of Image Sprawl)</p>
<p>There's a bunch of people out there that think I don't like docker,  they are wrong.</p>
<p>I just never understood the hype about it since I didn't see, (and still don't) see it being used at large and people seem to understand that as being against it.</p>
<p>So let me put a couple of things straight :</p>
<p>There's absolutely nothing wrong with using a <strong>container</strong> based approach when deploying your infrastructure.  If you remember my talks about the rise of Open Source Virtualization some years ago you've noticed that I've always mentioned OpenVZ and friends  as good alternatives if you wanted to have a lot of isolated platforms on one machine.     LXC and friends have grown .. they are even more usable these days.  Years ago people bought bare metal and ran Hypervisors on it to isolate resources.  These days people rent VM's and also want the same functionality so the use of the combination of Virtualization and Container based technologies is a very good match there.</p>
<p>There's also nothing wrong with using Infrastructure as Code tools to build an reproducable image you are going to deploy will  provide you with a disposable image which allows you to quickly launch a reproducable and versionned platform for your application  if that application is supposed to be shortlived.     The tooling around today is not yet there to have these images long lived as you still need to manage the config inside the containers as your application will evolve, it will change, your environment will change (think even about changing to a different loghost..) , but when you don't have to keep state you can dispose the image and redeploy a new reproducable one.</p>
<p>In the embedded world, this kind of approach with multiple banks has been a round for a while , one image running, a second bank as a fallback, and when you upgrade the passive bank you can swap the roles and still have roll back.</p>
<p>There's is also nothing wrong on combining these to approaches and using tools such as Docker and Packer. </p>
<p>But there is lot wrong with building images that then start living their own life,  tools like Veewee etc saw the light to create an easy way to make sure the JeOS image (Just Enough Operating System) we created was reproducable, not to ship around virtual appliances. </p>
<p>But, lets be realistic,  the number of applications that are suitable for this kind of environment  is small.   Most applications these days are still very statefull,  and when your application contains state you need to manage that<br />
that state, you can't just dispose an image which has state.  Specially in an Enterprise environment stateless, immutable applications are really the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>When your application maps with stateless and short lived,  or a some people like to call it Immutable please do so..  but if it doesn't please remember that we started using configuration management tools like CFengine, Puppet and Chef to prevent Image Sprawl and Config Drift<br />
There's proprietary businesses out there building tools to detect config drift and extort organisations to solve problems that shouldn't have existed in the first place.</p>
<p>Luckily the majority of smart people I've spoken to over the past couple of weeks pretty much confirmed this ...<br />
Like one of the larger devops minded appliation hosting outsourcers in emea, I asked them how much % of their customer base they could all "Immutable"   , exactly 0% was the answer.</p>
<p>Image Based Container solutions are definitely not a one size fits all solution, and we have along way to go before we get there if at all ..</p>
<p>Till then I like not to diffuse my attention to too many different types of deploying platforms, just not to make stuff more complex than it already is...as complexity is the enemy of reliability</p>

  <div class="content"><p>Lately there have been a lot of organisations trying to hire a devops engineer.<br />
I myselve have been asked to fill in devops roles .. </p>
<p>There's a number of issues with that.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is that I always have to ask what exactly the organisation is looking for.</p>
<p>So you want a devops engineer with experience in Linux, MongoDB, MySQL and  Java ,  does that mean you want a Java developer who is familiar with MySQL and Linux and breaths a devops Culture.<br />
Or a Linux expert who understands Java developers and knows how to tune Mongo and MySQL ?</p>
<p>It's absolutely unclear what you want when you are hiring "A devops engineer"</p>
<p>The second problem is that you are trying to hire people who are knowledgeable about  devops, </p>
<p>Yet a lot of those people know that you can't do devops on your own ,  devops is not a jobtitle. devops is not a new devops team you create.   </p>
<p>To some of them you are even making a fool out of yourselve,  as to them you show that you don't understand devops</p>
<p>On top .. the ones that do apply for this fancy new devops role, are the ones that might not get the fact that the problem isn't about tooling but about people working together and helping eachother , so you end up hiring the wrong people.</p>
<p>Even in todays devops culture a system engineer is still a system engineer,  and a developer is still a developer.<br />
You might have developers supporting the build tool chain, or system engineers focussing on infrastructure automation.</p>
<p>But as John said almost 3 years ago <a href="http://www.krisbuytaert.be/blog/apparently-devops-not-jobtitle#comment-3992">they are good at their job.</a></p>
<p>Devops is not a word you slap onto a tool, a team or a person and expect magic to happen </p>
<p>Let's face it .. devops is hard, you can't do this on your own .. you need to find the right people ..</p>
