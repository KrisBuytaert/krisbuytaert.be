<h3>Introduction </h3>
<hr>
               
<blockquote>
 This idea actually comes from <a 
href="http://dali.vision.auc.dk:8001/~rvc/curriculum.html">Zteel/Diffusion</A>. (I even ripped of his logo)
But for me it's mainly a summary to know for myself what I've done.

<h3>1989</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
 Late that year I saw my very first intro's and demo's.  <br>
 I started my first experiments on graphics programming on my 
 old EGA monitor which I still use for the board ;-)
 

</blockquote>
<h3>1990</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
 During this period I was really active in the warez / hpav scene.
 <strong>shame on me </strong>  <br>
Nothing really interresting so far except for some stupid scrollers that
we spread with our xxxx ;-)

</blockquote>
<h3>1991</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<li> I started running  my first own board "Bitfreak BBS" online 8 
hours a day on my 286/12 with 1 Mb and 20Mb , till my 
parents told me to stop it :(

<li> Bought my first Soundbastard and rewatched al my old demos/intros

<li> Moved from the Warez scene to the Demoscene.. stopped hacking/phreaking and other stuff..
<li> I founded Coders In Action , my vers first demo group , together 
with some schoolmates.  The earliest members were Black Hellcat 
Jr, Airborne and me.. 3 coders, no gfx , no music so it din't 
take long till we asked Frodo to join us for the music stuff 
since he and his nephew were rather active on that subject.

</blockquote> 
<h3>1992</h3> <hr> <blockquote>

<li> Started working together with <a  
href="http://www.ping.be/~ping6183/">Johan 
Hofmans</A>  on Einstein BBS after closing my own board for a while.
In no time we jumped from nowhere to the 7th spot in the Hoax charts.
<li> Coders In Action released their first (VGA) ( By Black HellCat Jr.) an 
second intro (EGA) (By Sleeping Dog)  
<li> I started writing articles for Hoax one of the better scene 
magazines back then.  The reason why I chose for hoax was quite 
easy.. back then there was a huge conflict between Imphobia and 
Access Denied and they were both working on a diskmag.   I 
didn't want to interfere and started writing for the other one 
;-)
<li> We met the Silicon Maze at on of our monthly sysop meetings and he 
joined the group shortly after that.  

</blockquote>

<h3>1993</h3> <hr> <blockquote> 


<li>We kept growing, I 
made sure we found some shop stupid enough to pay our phonebills 
And we started joining several scene networks (CDN and Cabinet 
at that moment if I remember correctly ..)
<li> We had our first BBS Barbeque where we acutally didn't do anything 
else but watching (1) all Assembly'93 releases (2) Watching users loggin 
in and out downloading all releases 'cause we were one of the first 
boards to have them.  This is one of the things that over the years 
happens almost after every party.. hours before I come home I see users 
loggin in and out to see if there already is something..

<li> We planned our first demo for The Party III, however there was one
big problem.  How the hell can we get in Denmark ??  2 days before the 
Party we had half a demo ready (some parts were later used in our first 
real demo..) but no transportation.. the only way to go there was a 18 
hour during train trip and nobody was interrested.. so we stayed home 
again , waiting for the releases ...



</blockquote> <h3>1994</h3> <hr>
<blockquote>

<li> May : My first party : Bizarre'94.  Some stupid ductch jury members 
forgot to count the votes for our demo.  We should have won the party, and
that was not only our opinion but the one of lot's of people that were at
the party.
 <li> Shortly after Bizarre'94 we started polling Gsn and Dgi from Finland

 <li> 
Assembly'94, 5-7 : Purple Zebra , Emperor and myselve went to this famous
event where we met lot's of people during the party we 
renamed our group from Coders In Action to The Natives.  I also met the
other people behind Hoax and we exchanged some ideas on new articles.


<li>October 1994, the first real party in Belgium Organized by Antares in
Mons, great party real fun atmosphere, but it was really obvious that this
was the first party those people organised, so we helped them out by
setting up a local network ourselves.

<li>December came and we still had nothing finished for The Party'94 but
we had a great time in Denmark. In the meanwhile I had met Uncle Bob and
Balex-T from Zion they were working some great stuff for their group.

<h3>1995</h3>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<li> Zion died and both members joined The Natives, early february we went
to The Meeting'95 in Lille, not really a good party, We came in
saturdaymorning and the hall wasn't even half filled however it was
already the second day.  It seemed like my stereo was a bit louder then
the one from the organisation so we used it for the compo's.  We were
getting bored so we decided on writing a 4kb intro and we won the 4kb
intro competition.

<li> Apr : X'95 
<li> Apr : Became Imphobia Editor
<li> Jul : SomeWhere In Holland'95 : partly setup the party network
<li> Aug : Assembly'95 : spent too much money for nothing (off course chicks 
were for free)
<li> Sep : Bizarre'95 <br>
  Organised Belgian Scene Barbeque
<li> Nov : Wired'95 : Organisation
<li> Dec : Organised Belgian Scene Meeting #1<br> 
	The Party'95 : Sucked

<h3>Summa Sumarum<hr></h3>
<blockquote>
So what have I, and the groups I've been in, released over the years? You 
have most of it in the Curriculum Vitae, but it might be rather confusing 
if you just want the plain facts. So here it is, a summary of my work.
