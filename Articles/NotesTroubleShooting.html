<p>
The following list provides you with some info on problems that can occur 
when trying to install Lotus Notes on a RedHat 7.1 box.
</p>
<p>People often mail me about issues on RedHat 8.0 or RedHat 9, so far we
have not been able to get Notes working on those version, ( we didn't try
that much yet either ;)) , we have most version up and running on RedHat
7.3 however.
</p>


<h1>NIC.pm</h1>
<p>
During the installation you get the following error.
<pre>
An unexpected error occured during post-install processing:
Died at (eval 34) line 2.
        ...propagated at (eval 33) line 231.
/home/notes/linux/tools/lib/NIC.pm line 727
The installation failed for the local host.
</pre>
<p>
Notes Installation does NOT like symlinks.. so if you wanted so keep the 
default settings however you did not enough diskspace  and created 
symlinks for the /opt/notes and /local/notesdata this is what happens.
</p><P>
Try running the install with other directories again and you won`t have 
the same problem.

<h1>libstdc++-libc6.1-1.so.2</h1>
<p>
I get the following error when starting 
</p>
<pre>
[notes@dhcp97 notesdata]$ /opt/lotus/bin/http httpsetup
/opt/lotus/notes/latest/linux/http: error while loading shared libraries: 
libstdc++-libc6.1-1.so.2: cannot load shared object file: No such file or 
directory
</pre>
<p>
you have a wrong verscion of libstdc check in your /usr/lib if you have a 
file with a different version number, e.g. 
</p>
<pre>
ln -s  libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3  libstdc++-libc6.1-1.so.2
</pre>

<h1>libjitc.so</h1>
<p>



I get the following error when starting 
<pre>
[notes@dhcp97 notesdata]$ /opt/lotus/bin/http httpsetup

<p>
This means that notes does not find its Java Libraries.  Either they are not installed or you have to 
include them in your  /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig  afterwards.

</p>

<h1><a name="sigsev">--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---</a></h1>
<p>
When starting http httpsetup it stops just after 

<pre>

This is again a Java library problem 
You can verify this by running strace -p $pidofnotes 
you should normally then get a list of 


<pre>
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---</pre>


This has everything to do with your JDK.
Let`s tackle this problem step by step.
remove the file libjava.so in /opt/lotus/notes/latest/linux

now try starting the httpsetup again you should see a listing like this
<pre>
[notes@dhcp97 notesdata]$ /opt/lotus/bin/http httpsetup
10/18/2001 01:43:53 PM

*****************************************
10/18/2001 01:43:53 PM  JVM: The JVM runtime library could not be found.
10/18/2001 01:43:53 PM  JVM: Java Virtual Machine failed to start
10/18/2001 01:43:53 PM  HTTP server error, could not load the Java VM
10/18/2001 01:43:53 PM  HTTP Web Server started
</pre>
<p>
As you can see this works but you don`t have a JVM available.
</p>


<p>
Recently I have discovered that with the java versions that are currently
included with Notes there are less problems.
</p>
<pre>
[root@linnotes linux]# more /etc/redhat-release 
Red Hat Linux release 7.3 (Valhalla)
[root@linnotes linux]# ./java -version 
java.bin version "1.1.8"
[root@linnotes linux]# pwd
/opt/lotus/notes/50100/linux
</pre>

<p>
No problem there .. but we use the java version included with Notes .


</p>

<h1>Lotus Notes: error 0x102</h1>
<p>


You get Error : Lotus Notes: error 0x102
this basically is a permission problem, make sure you run 
chown -R notes.notes /opt/lotus , this should normally solve the problem.
</p>

<h1>Segfaulting on RH 9</h1>
<p>When trying to install Domino on RH9 , we encountered frequrens segmentation faults. 
</p>
<pre>export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5</pre>
<p>
Solves these segfaults
