      <font size="5" color="#8B2AF2"><b>F</b></font>rom the start of the 
      Internet, a large percentage of net usage has been taken up by the sending 
      of e-mail. The importance of e-mail as an Internet application quickly led 
      to its targeting by malicious users. In particular, the first big problem 
      was, and still remains, the use of e-mail to spread all sorts of 
      disruptive virus programs. The key to success for the perpetrator is 
      inattention on the part of users to open every attachment they get from 
      any stranger. </font></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">Today there are over 570 
      million electronic mailboxes on the Internet. That's almost 2 mailboxes 
      per user. For many of these users, there is now emerging an even bigger 
      problem than the occasional e-mail virus: The new menace is the daily 
      bombardment of unsolicited commercial e-mail (UCE) dubbed spam. No longer 
      just a means of interpersonal communication, e-mail has become a powerful 
      and cost-effective business tool subject to abuse. </font></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">Those not bound by the 
      slightest thought of netiquette have developed a clever set of techniques 
      for collecting e-mail addresses at a very low cost. Collectively dubbed 
      spamware, there are a number of software packages that enable the practice 
      of spamming and often have no other apparent purpose.
      <a target="_blank" href="http://home.attbi.com/~desktopserver2000/atomicharvester.htm">

      <font color="#FF0000">Desktop Server IV</font></a> will bulk-mail to lists 
      directly without using a full-fledged e-mail server. Such electronic 
      infrastructure opens the potential of sending millions of unsolicited 
      direct-marketing messages at the push of a button. </font></p>

      <img border="0" src="gifs/cnil.gif" align="left" width="193" height="100"></a><font face="Helvetica">Spam 
      is getting out of hand and, with the exception of the EU, government 
      legislation lags years behind. In France, the Commission Nationale de 
      l'Informatique et des Libertés (<b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnil.fr">CNIL</a></b>) 
      has developed a working definition of spam: “bulk-mailing, sometimes 
      repeatedly, of unsolicited e-mail messages, usually of a commercial 
      nature, to individuals with whom the mailer has had no previous contact 
      and whose e-mail addresses the mailer collected from the public spaces of 
      the Internet: newsgroups, mailing lists, directories, web sites etc.”
      </font></p>
      <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">Without waiting for US 
      Congress to act, a number of states are tackling the problem of spam on a 
      very basic level. Local statutes prohibit the forging of addresses and the 
      doctoring of message headers and subject lines. Nonetheless, they fall 
      short of the real problem of spam: It is unsolicited. The timid response 
      to this issue is a requirement for opt-out requests to be honored. </font>

    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">A similar debate on opt-in 
    versus opt-out has raged in the European Parliament. The European Commission 
    led by Erkki Liikanen, Finnish parliamentarian and European Commissioner for 
    Enterprise and the Information Society who is also an ardent Open Source 
    proponent, favored an opt-in position on commercial e-mail. In his argument, 
    Liikanen cited the case of Japan where up to 85% of 850 million text 
    messages contain unsolicited junk mail. </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">While there was universal 
    condemnation of spam, Baroness Sarah Ludford, Liberal Democrat from London, 
    along with other EU parliamentarians, did not think that civil liberties 
    were an issue. They argued that sending junk mail was already illegal and 
    the additional constraints of an 'opt-in' e-mail system could have adverse 
    consequences for small firms and charities. Liikanen, however, would not 
    agree to differentiate between different forms of communications such as 
    faxes, text mobile phone messages, and e-mail when it came to opt-in versus 
    opt-out rules. </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">In the end, Liikanen held 
    the day and on May 30th the EU Parliament voted to adopt the EC directive 
    making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or other similar 
    advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not have a preexisting 
    business relationship. This formalized adoption of an opt-in policy will 
    make Europe a spam-free zone by the end of 2003. </font></td>

    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">There is a very practical 
    side to the argument against spam: It wastes resources and resources are 
    money. How much time do your employees lose while browsing their mailbox 
    searching the valuable e-mails from clients and suppliers in the huge pile 
    of spam? Maybe you are still using a dial-up connection to fetch your e-mail 
    and your phone bill rises because you have to stay online longer than 
    actually needed. The storage you planned on your mail server isn't enough 
    for the needs of your users, and their mailboxes get filled up with spam 
    each day. You pay for your bandwidth. You pay to get e-mail delivered to 
    you. Do you want to pay to have unwanted, irrelevant, marketing e-mail 
    messages clogging your inbox?</font></p>

    Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial e-mail (<b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cauce.org">CAUCE</a></b>). 
    This volunteer organization, which is active in driving US legislation

    <img border="0" src="gifs/ietflogo2e[1].gif" align="left" hspace="2" width="140" height="80"></a>But 
    while you are waiting for government action, how can you defend against 
    spammers and their spamware today? To be successful, spammers need to trick 
    people into opening their mail. Therefore, you have to be able to recognize 
    spam before you see it. Fortunately, that’s a lot easier than it sounds. In 
    particular the Internet Engineering Task Force posted recommendations (<b><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2505.txt">rfc2505</a></b>) 
    in early 1999 on how to improve the effectiveness of e-mail servers when 
    filtering spam.</font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">Characteristically, most 
    of the time spam is not directed to you. It’s sent either to a long list of 
    people or to an invisible mailing list. Either way, you are most likely on 
    that list not as a recipient, but as an alias as they try to hide the 
    thousands of recipients. What’s more, spammers invariably try to hide from 
    where they are mailing. They will try to forge headers and write from 
    &quot;non-existing&quot; e-mail addresses. If they use bulk-mailing desktop software, 
    their mail will not have a legitimate MX DNS record. As a result, they will 
    often hijack an insecure e-mail server that does not check the validity of 
    messages before sending them. Such an e-mail server is dubbed an open relay.
    </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">
    <a target="_self" href="../../Vol_35/SuSE_email/SuSE_email.htm">
    <img border="0" src="../../Vol_35/SuSE_email/gifs/email_server.gif" align="left" hspace="3" width="59" height="80"></a>With 
    all of this in mind, the IETF focused on stopping spam at the e-mail server 
    and in particular honed in on preventing open relays. They recommended 
    testing for a fully qualified domain names (FQDN) and not just an IP address 
    number. In addition, they recommended verification testing of the sending 
    server by the receiving server using the SMTP HELO statement. These are 
    precisely the kinds of spam-prevention tests that have been added to Open 
    Source e-mail servers as openBench Labs demonstrated in a recent review of 
    the Postfix-based
    <a target="_self" href="../../Vol_35/SuSE_email/SuSE_email.htm">SuSE eMail 
    Server 3.1</a>. </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">They will fill the subject 
    line with lots of &quot;!&quot;, &quot;?&quot;, and other tricks. The body of a spam message 
    will also contain some typical telltale elements. The message will often 
    contain language telling you how much money you can earn with their program. 
    Having never heard of the word netiquette, spammers will also use caps to 
    yell at you and get your attention. Often spammers will promise goodies, if 
    you go to a website, fill in a form, or call their hotline. Spammers will 
    often use html-based messages in order to embed hidden links to their 
    websites in order to track you. And even more insidious, most spam will 
    contain exhaustive efforts to convince you that it is not spam. </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">All of those techniques 
    can be detected using spam filters. Most e-mail applications can filter 
    messages based on the subject. So you could decide to delete automatically 
    every e-mail with a subject that starts with &quot;Get rich fast.&quot; That could 
    become quite tedious, however, if spammers can fool your e-mail application 
    with a simple change of the subject like “Get very rich very fast!” What you 
    need is some good Open Source anti-spamware. </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">Blacklists are as old as 
    the Internet. Often people don't want to receive mail from a certain domain, 
    blocking mails from recruitment agencies, blocking mails from competitors 
    etc, so they create a list of domains that they block. There are many 
    different blacklists, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mail-abuse.org">
    http://www.mail-abuse.org</a> and
    <a target="_blank" href="http://spam.abuse.net">http://spam.abuse.net</a> 
    are just a couple of the existing lists. What it comes down to is that if 
    you are a spammer, you will get listed sooner or later. And once you are 
    listed, people will block your domain or servers from sending mail to their 
    servers. </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">
    <a target="_blank" href="http://razor.sourceforge.net/index.html">
    <img border="0" src="gifs/razor.gif" align="left" hspace="2" width="183" height="40"></a>The most 
    basic characteristic of spam message is the presence of thousands of 
    thousands of duplicates. As a result, if you can catch multiple versions of 
    the same message, there is a good chance that the message you just received 
    might be spam. Vipul’s Razor is a distributed, collaborative, spam detection 
    and filtering network. Through user contributions, Razor establishes a 
    catalogue of spam in propagation based on message checksums. This catalogue 
    is consulted by e-mail clients to filter out known spam. Detection is done 
    with statistical and randomized signatures that efficiently spot mutating 
    spam content. </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spamassassin.org/">
    <img border="0" src="gifs/ninjalogo.gif" align="left" width="105" height="40"></a>Another 
    alternative is SpamAssassin. This software uses a blacklist, header 
    checking, and body analysis just as Razor. In fact, SpamAssassin includes 
    Razor as one of its tests. Based on the content of the subject line, the 
    number of recipients, and either the originating mail server or the relay 
    server used, the header of a mail message reveals a lot of information about 
    that message. SpamAssassin scores each of these characteristics, either 
    negative (unlikely to be spam) or positive (likely to be spam) values. 
    Following the header, SpamAssassin then analyzes the body of an e-mail.&nbsp; 
    Based on the total score a mail gets, on all different parts, you can decide 
    whether a mail gets filtered into a separate mailbox or not. </font></td>
