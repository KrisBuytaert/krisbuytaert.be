    Michael Schrage, a co-director of the MIT Media Lab, who focuses on shared 
    workspaces as absolute precursors for innovation. If you truly want to 
    collaborate, you need shared space. The shared space, he adds, becomes the 
    medium through which people work and the fundamental source of good ideas.
    </font>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">Schrage often references 
    his Napkin Example. Two people are at a lunch counter. One writes something 
    on a napkin to explain his idea. The other alters the sketch on the napkin 
    to relay that second person’s idea. If a waiter were to come and remove the 
    paper, the conversation would go away. </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">Schrage argues that you 
    are no longer talking to that other person: You are talking with the other 
    person through a reference point. This reference point becomes the dynamic.
    </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">For the hordes of people 
    all over the world who use Wiki, they are apt to argue that Wiki is the best 
    ‘shared space’ going. Wiki is an Open Source tool for collaboration. With 
    Wiki, everyone has edit access to everything. Wiki allows the organization 
    of contributions to be edited in addition to the content itself. “Open 
    editing&quot; means that everyday users create and edit any page in a web site. 
    Anyone can go into a document, make additions, amendments, deletions, edits, 
    and reformats….Scary! </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">Doesn’t that lead to 
    chaos—or, even worse, garbage? There is a counter-response for those who 
    think Wiki might be an information disaster waiting to happen. Wiki users 
    say, What disaster? </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">They point out that Wiki 
    has a Darwinian safety valve that makes any Wiki project look less like A 
    Night at the Opera and more like A Day at the Labs. That safety lies in the 
    fact that changes get stored in a log. Another user can come in and review 
    the log and can instantly undo a change deemed as unfit. The argument goes 
    that if ugly graffiti can be corrected in seconds, the third-rate graffiti 
    artist is not motivated to spend hours crafting a badly executed scrawl, 
    only to see it nullified over and over again. The content that survives is 
    the content that everyone has agreed is best. </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">What's more, instead of 
    having a scenario where one informs an editor of a desired change, and await 
    a series of exchanges, Wiki lets the change-maker do it alone, immediately. 
    This carries with it not only efficiencies but laudable economics, since it 
    pares transaction costs. With Wiki, Brooks’ Law is turned on its ear. The 
    more people looking at something, rather than inviting mischief and errors, 
    leads to a better chance of finding things for improvement. </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">While it can be argued 
    that only a limited number of core developers lead the way in software 
    design even in collaborative Open Source, Wiki and its clones are proving 
    that a large network of contributors can produce high-quality information in 
    a collaborative environment. “What I find is that people who use Wiki 
    absolutely love it,” says Joseph Cothrel, Vice President of Research at 
    Participate.com. </font></p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica">Not everyone finds it 
    lovable, however (see Desmond Moleski’s commentary). Nor is it something you 
    immediately know what to do with. As the declaration
    <a target="_blank" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhyWikiWorks">Why Wiki Works</a> 
    explains, “Wiki is an intelligence test of sorts to be able to edit a Wiki 
    page. It’s not rocket science, but it doesn’t appeal to the TV-watchers. If 
    it doesn’t appeal, they don’t participate, which leaves those of us who read 
    and write to get on with rational discourse.” </font></td>

        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">From my 
        experience, Wiki is an ideal tool for those who want to work together on 
        a document. In its original description, Wiki is described as The 
        simplest online database that could possibly work. At Stone-IT, a 
        consulting firm, we use a Wiki to create a technical knowledge base, 
        where parts of our client documentation are in a Wiki. Our sales force 
        uses the Wiki to collaborate with consultants on proposals. No client 
        ever sees the Wiki, yet lots of information that they are given was 
        actually generated from the Wiki. We find it’s an ideal tool to draft a 
        document and receive feedback. </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">The term &quot;wiki 
        wiki&quot; means quick in the Hawaiian language and is used to identify 
        either a type of hypertext document or the software used to write it. 
        Often called Wiki for short, the collaborative software application 
        enables web documents to be authored collectively, using a simple markup 
        scheme. The resulting collaborative hypertext document, also called 
        either Wiki or Wiki Wiki Web, is typically produced by a community of 
        users. </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">What’s its 
        business value? A Wiki isn't intended to be a fully-fledged content 
        management system; it’s a tool to collaborate. Should one even consider 
        it as the way to create a corporate site? Probably not. Neither is it a 
        solution for creating an authoritative support site, since people often 
        don't trust a Wiki. Nonetheless, you can use a Wiki to gather content 
        from contributors and from there create an authoritative document.
        </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">For those 
        just getting started, most Wikis have a Sandbox where you can play in, 
        to get accustomed. Many Wikis are immediately identifiable by their use 
        of CamelCase, produced by capitalizing words in a phrase and removing 
        the spaces between them. This turns the phrase into an automatic link.
        </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">But backing 
        away from details into fundamentals, what are the actual advantages to 
        be gained in using a Wiki? </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">It’s the 
        easiest way to edit online: Easy, as in, just go ahead and type your 
        ideas, preview, save, and your page is online, ready for the world to 
        read. If you want to create a new page, just type the name of the page 
        in WikiWord, such as NewPage or DetailedExplanation, into your current 
        text. After you save the page, the Wiki will generate a link for you, 
        follow the link, and edit happily. Can it get any easier ? </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">It does, if 
        you want to create tables or embed code (C/Perl/...) in the page. There 
        are no extra tools required, just your browser. You don’t need to know 
        anything about HTML or any other W3C standard. There is no problem in 
        uploading your files to the web server using ftp, or secure copy, and no 
        hassle in transferring the files in binary or ASCII mode. You don’t need 
        to remember in which directory you have to put the files. </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Or, you can 
        always carry Wiki steps further as a collaboration tool with real 
        Classroom applications, blackboard solutions, where you can work with 
        different people on a “desktop:” Most often a Java applet where your 
        people can follow your mouse pointer. </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Yes, there is 
        version control. While some people can destroy the contents of the Wiki 
        without actually intending to, this is not really a problem, since most 
        Wikis support some kind of version control. You can roll back to an 
        older version of a document, before the inattentive user deleted a page. 
        Also, you can lock pages, which means a user can’t edit that page.
        </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">While people 
        complain that there is no fine-grained authorization scheme, a Wiki 
        isn't intended to be a fully fledged content management system: It's a 
        tool to collaborate. Next to that, you can protect your pages to some 
        level by obliging your users to log in. You only allow pages to be 
        edited by users that are logged in, and you can even add password 
        protection if desired. </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Which Wiki 
        should you use? It isn't easy to migrate from one to another. If you are 
        thinking about setting up an environment where you can easily create 
        documents in Docbook style, check out the Lampadas Project (http://www.lampadas.org/).
        </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Lampadas is a 
        powerful, flexible platform designed to support large documentation 
        projects such as the LDP. It provides an interactive environment for 
        writing, managing, publishing, and reading documentation. They based 
        parts of their environment on the Wiki style of editing but took it even 
        further. The Lampadas project has been adopted by both the Linux 
        Documentation Project and Gnome Documentation project. </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">As for sites 
        that make use of Wiki, the list is uncountable. There are, however, some 
        interesting ones to mention here as samplings. Their scope and purpose 
        vary. </font></p>

        collaborations. Software engineer Desmond Moleski thinks not. Earlier 
        this year, he introduced Wiki at his company, Clarity Visual Systems. By 
        year’s end, he's the only one actively using it. With eyes wide open,

        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">Last April, I 
        attended a talk by Ward Cunningham [creator of Wiki] at the regular 
        Portland Linux Unix Group meeting. I'd never heard of a Wiki Wiki Web 
        before that night and I found the idea very exciting. </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">The

        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">As part of my 
        development projects, I administer an internal Linux test server on 
        which I installed UseMod Wiki in April. For the first few weeks I tried 
        to enlist others in the company to experiment with the Wiki as a 
        collaborative tool, with some success. However, after a month or so I 
        was the only active author of Wiki pages. </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">What kept 
        Wiki from becoming an important tool for the company? I’m the only 
        application software engineer; a small number of embedded software, 
        hardware, and mechanical engineers round out the technical staff. My 
        goal was (and is) to explore the Wiki concept in action, as well as to 
        enable collaboration. </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">When I ran 
        around and showed it to people, it was empty. I didn't stop to think and 
        take time to author some clearly useful pages before bothering all the 
        people busy trying to keep the company afloat. I just got excited and 
        assumed a certain cohort would also get excited and then we would all 
        start filling our Wiki with good stuff. </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">I jumped the 
        gun. An excited geek leaping around spouting abstractions with funny

        a useful tool. </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">We're a small 
        company. The bulk of collaborative effort can be handled face to face. 
        If someone misses the conversation, they will get a recap sooner or 
        later. If a document results from collaboration and if it deserves to 
        live, someone just chucks it in the old reliable X: drive, instead of 
        some newfangled web thingy with a funny name. </font></p>
        <p style="text-indent: 10"><font face="Helvetica" size="2">We’re a small

        a community of authors to be really successful. As a small company, our 
        pool of potential authors is quite small. They just don't need a tool
