    e-mail grows in usage and complexity, so have mail applications, including 
    POP and IMAP servers. One serious challenge for systems administration is 
    simply that there are so many different mail solutions around. Consider this 
    brief overview of advantages and disadvantages of various message transfer 
    agents (MTAs), IMAP alternatives, and ways to move toward what we try to 
    define as a zero administration setup.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 10"><span style="font-family: Helvetica">In the old 
    days people read their mail from a file in /var/spool/mail. The mail was 
    delivered to that file by the MTAs and user applications read that file. As 
    this was the only file where mail was stored, corruption of the file meant 
    loss of mail. Concurrent read and write operations could generate problems, 
    as using NFS could create locking issues. Therefore a new system for 
    delivering mail was developed by qmail, called Maildir. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica">In this setup, mail is no longer 
    delivered to one file but to a directory in which each mail represents a 
    separate file. An MTA this way can read and delete messages while other mail 
    is still being delivered. The biggest advantage of this format is &quot;NO 
    LOCKS.&quot; Maildir even works without trouble over NFS, which is a big 
    advantage for distributed environments and environments where mail is being 
    left on the server for backup.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica">Along with single-file mail stores, the 
    old way of storing users in /etc/passwd is becoming obsolete. More and more 
    people are using virtual users, domains, or aliases stored in LDAP or MySQL. 
    Users are no longer being created locally on a machine, which gives one 
    central point for administration and an easier integration with billing and 
    human resources tools.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica">Depending on your needs you may want to 
    separate out two functionalities: Some business environments need a mail 
    relay that sits in the DMZ, scans mails for viruses, and relays the mails 
    further on to the local network where the actual mail-server is located. 
    Other business environments want their actual mail-server to be in the DMZ. 
    If you want to go for a low-maintenance architecture, integration with 
    either LDAP or MySQL is a must. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica">The Lightweight Directory Access 
    Protocol (LDAP) is a protocol for accessing online directory services. It 
    runs directly over TCP, and can be used to access a standalone LDAP 
    directory service or directory service back-ended by X.500. LDAP is becoming 
    the central user management repository for the enterprise. More and more 
    environments are relying on LDAP for user and resource management; MTAs and 
    other applications get user information not from the old /etc/passwd but 
    from a database, which in this case is an LDAP-based database. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica">MySQL Integration is easy to combine 
    with billing infrastructures. You might even want to hand a part of the user 
    administration to clients themselves by defining a web-based maintenance 
    application.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica">Unfortunately, the documentation that 
    typically comes with an MTA is often less than desirable. It may appear 
    cryptic and you need to know what you are looking for before you can even 
    begin searching for the correct syntax. Working with Sendmail? The general 
    rule is that you need the bat book from O'Reilly. Looking for more about 
    qmail? Then you need to read the FAQ and to try to find bits and parts on a 
    chaotic website. If you are after exim, the better news is that exim has 
    good basic installation documentation, but you’re on your own for the more 
    complex stuff. As for postfix, you can learn the most from the README files 
    that are delivered with the product.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica">Systems administrators know one thing 
    to be very clear about MTAs: Security is a big hassle. MTAs are one of the 
    most fragile services on the Internet. Remote exploits for MTAs have 
    produced some of the biggest problems for system administrators. It was no 
    surprise that people would eventually get tired of the security holes in 
    Sendmail and try to offer something better. Security expert <b>Wietse Venema 
    developed his own MTA, released under the name of </b></span><b>
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: windowtext">postfix</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica">, 
    and Dan Bernstein came up with qmail. </span></b>
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica">Venema and Bernstein have since 
    discussed different security architectures in their MTA and both have made 
    strong points about security design. Both postfix and qmail are 
    comparatively secure products. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica">Knowing about the popularity of mail 
    servers lends a clear sign of how much support will be available. Earlier 
    this year, I did a search on the Google site on the four servers, postfix, 
    qmail, exim, and sendmail, just to get an idea of which was being discussed 
    the most. </span></p>

    </ul>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica">This shows that sendmail, with all the 
    talk about security holes, still is the most discussed MTA around. 
    Nonetheless, the numbers also show that use of both postfix and qmail are 
    widespread. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 10">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica">It’s always possible to configure an 
    environment to test the actual performance of these mail-servers. For 
    purposes of staying within the scope of this document, we can instead note a 
    study that was performed by Matthias Andree which actually shows that 
    postfix is the faster MTA available. See </span>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Helvetica">Developed by Dan 
      Bernstein who was sick of the security holes in sendmail and other MTAs, 
      qmail features security not just as a goal but as a requirement. The 
      operating theory is that mail delivery is critical for users; it cannot be 
      turned off, and it must be completely secure. Qmail also supports Maildir, 
      a format where mail is not stored in one big file but in separate files in 
      one directory. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Helvetica">Since qmail has 
      its own way of distributing mail in a parallel way, it makes an ideal 
      server for mailing lists that need fast outgoing email. According to the 
      qmail site : &quot;On a Pentium under BSD/OS, qmail can easily sustain 200,000 
      local messages per day. That’s separate messages injected and delivered to 
      mailboxes in a real test! Although remote deliveries are inherently 
      limited by the slowness of DNS and SMTP, qmail overlaps 20 simultaneous 
      deliveries by default, so it zooms quickly through mailing lists.”</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Helvetica">Courier is the 
      most flexible Maildir -based IMAP server available. It supports abstract 
      authentication modules. Authentication of login user-id and password is 
      wrapped up into a completely stand-alone module. Several modules are 
      provided to authenticate using the traditional password/shadow files, via 
      the PAM library, from a table on a MySQL server, or from an LDAP server 
      (requires MySQL or Open-LDAP). An experimental authentication module for 
      PostgreSQL is also available. You can write your own custom 
      user-id/password validation program. A &quot;custom&quot; authentication module is 
      included, which authenticates absolutely nothing. Add your own code to it 
      in order to implement a site-specific authentication mechanism. Courier-IMAP 
      is a server that provides IMAP access to Maildirs. This IMAP server does 
      NOT handle traditional mailbox files (/var/spool/mail, and derivatives), 
      it was written for the specific purpose of providing IMAP access to 
      Maildirs. </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Helvetica">The overall 
      design goal of Courier-IMAP is to provide IMAP services to maildirs with 
      the least amount of resources. For this reason there are many parameters 
      that can be tuned during initial configuration and at runtime. Unwanted 
      components can be removed completely, and they will not take up any 
      resources. Few sites need the ability to search messages in 20 different 
      character sets, so there's no need to waste memory storing large character 
      set mapping tables. Sites that need multilingual searching and sorting 
      abilities can selectively choose which character set tables will be 
      supported by the server, individually. If SSL support is needed, it is 
      available. If not, the SSL wrapper does not have to be installed at all. 
      If the server does not have the sufficient resources to sort large 
      folders, the server-based IMAP sorting function can be turned off. Courier 
      does POP3 (+SSL) as well as being part of an integrated suite.</span><img border="0" src="../../../Structure_GIFs/end_open.gif" width="14" height="14"><span style="font-family: Helvetica">
