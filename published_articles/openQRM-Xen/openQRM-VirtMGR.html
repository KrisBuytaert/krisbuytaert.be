>openQRM gives you a framework from which you can deploy and boot different images on available (idle) resources.   This way you can use the resources in your datacenter to the max.  openQRM has a flexible plugin structure that enables integration with different other tools such as Nagios, HypericHQ, Webmin and many others.   One of the nicest features of   openQRM is partitioning.  It is this partitioning technique that allows you to deploy multiple virtual machine instances in a farm, as if they just  were  different idle resources.  Today, openQRM has support for different virtualisation techniques such as Xen and VMWare, but other technologies are supported from the openQRM community.</P

></LI
></UL
>

And you need  of course the machines you have, network bootable, lots of them.

OpenQRM allows you to take any given boot image, suitable for your specific hardware and combine it with a filesystemimage.
Now the fact that you can mix and combine bootimages and filesystems makes it extremely interesting.  The most persistent problem I`m having these days is that each time I get a new hardware class (so ever 18 months) we have to do minor tweaks to our bootstrap environment, and if we want to deploy old hardware on new platforms that's often tricky,  the problem isn't really the technical issue but the human part of realizing you are about to use other hardware and mapping the right initrd to the right machine.  Off course you can build and test and get new machines to work on older distro's but it takes time, and openQRM helps you there.&#13;</P
><P
>With openQRM you can build a booting environment that works for all your hardware independently of the image that will actually be booted, whether it's an old or a new platform, you don't need to take care of the hardware dependancies.</P
><P
>Unless you are using the Local Deploy plugin deploying a node does not mean that you are installing an OS on a server, It just means you are booting a platform and putting it in production.
Within this kind of deployment you still have different types 
You have 
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Single deployment ,  1 image running on 1 machine </P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Shared deployment :  deploy the same filesystem on multiple machines,  define pools where you need a number of resources per type filesystem and load balance between those instances.  (add openMosix or some  other SSI technology for your own pleasure) </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Partitioned deployment: Rather than using full machines you can partition a machine  with different virtual machines.  This can be done with the same filesystem images.  . Today plugins for Xen,  plugins for VMWare, Linux VServer and Qemu are about to be integrated into openQRM.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><P
>Once you boot your nodes from the network, they arrive in an idle state.  When you tell openQRM you need a new virtual platform one of the idle nodes gets promoted to a production node based on existing resources and matching requirements from the meta data in a Virtual Environment.</P
><P
>Obviously you need to have a working PXE and Dhcpd environment, but there are  openQRM packages available that do that for you, so you don't need to worry about setting it up yourself, although you are free to use an existing platform.  </P

></H2

>OpenQRM comes to you in a bunch of prebuild RPM's or you can choose to download the source code..  
Off course the RPM's are the quickest way to get up and running from a  minimal Centos 4.2 with already MySQL installed  on it .. 
Note that you need a working MySQL database and plenty of memory to get started as openQRM is starting it's own Java application server and will create some tables in a MySQL database .

The installer  will guide you first trough a number of options you can choose from ,
then create it's databases and start configuring it services.  	It will also create a boot-image from your running kernel.
And finally the installer will try to start the qrm-server .&#13;</P
><P
> 
Would it surprise you if I told you that the majority of logfiles openQRM creates can be found in /var/log/qrm  ? 
Typical things that go wrong are running out of memory or database connections that fail.
But apart from these problems, no significant issues have been reported.&#13;</P
><P
>So we are almost ready with our openQRM installation,  Let's point our browser now to http://yourserver:8080/ and see what 's happening there :)
(the default username is qrm and so is the password.) If the installation was successful you  now have a working openQRM setup with no resources, no virtual environments but at least 1 boot image.&#13;</P

>The concept of openQRM is that your system images over the network.
This means you need other plugins such as the dhcpd and tftp plugin in our case, or you can use dhcpd and tftp server already existing on  your infrastructure.

You can still configure and install them via ./qrm-configurator in /opt/qrm

By selecting the plugin option there you can enable plugins.   So to start you need to enable dhcpd and tftpd ,  An example dhcpd.conf can be found in the plugin.</P

So now that you have openQRM up and running, you have configured the dhcpd server and you have an operational tftpserver you still need to define a boot image.</P

>&#13;A virtual environment is the combination of a  bootimage and a filesystem image,  you can mix and match, hence making images boot on different platforms , physical or virtual.
A default boot image is being built when you install openQRM , but you can build other boot images from kernels you prefer.

The tftpboot expects a file called  vmlinuz-qrm in /opt/qrm/tftpboot/boot, if that doesn't exist yet you can regenerate it by running
qrm-admin init-system from /opt/qrm/sbin&#13;</P

a valuable alternative to VMWare.</P

>Adding Xen to your machine changes it from an ordinary x86 alike machine to a totally new platform.  It's not an x86 anymore, it's a Xen architecture now.
All the operating systems that you want to run on your machine won't work anymore if they only know about x86, they need to know about Xen.  Off course the Xen and x86 architecture are really similar , so for the end user and the applications that run on a platform ported to Xen there is almost no difference.</P

>When Xen is activated it will also need to boot it's first virtual machine, called Domain0,  Domain0 has more privileges than the other virtual machines and typically is only used for managing the other (less privileged) virtual machines. Domain0 is also responsible for managing the hardware.

Assuming you get an IP for your next idle node you will see a new idle resource pop up in your openQRM dashboard for each virtual machine you started.</P
><P
>Now if you think about it.. what would your next step be ?  Indeed create a virtual environment that uses a Xen kernel and has a partition as a minimal resource.  You can configure the environment on the right hand side of the Virtual Environment config page.
Once you saved this new configuration you can start it and you should see one of your idle virtual machine instances being rebooted and your last created virtual environment should boot.</P
><P
>Off course apart from stopping and starting virtual machines , you can do much more from the Actions|Xen-Config option on the Resources view. 
You can pause and unpause partitions,  You can modify the ram configuration, you can add virtual CPU's and you can modify the CPU Assignment, and last but not least you can do migrations of partitions.</P

>In a nutshell I have shown shortly what openQRM is all about,  and how you can get started.  More info can be found on the openQRM website openqrm.sf.net. </P
><P
>We haven't even touched  the more advanced openQRM features such as failover , local-deploy and how their plugin system eases you to add more tools you already know in the same dashboard where examples such as Webmin and Nagios are already available , or even the other offerings such as High Availability and Workload migration that Qlusters offers.</P
><P
>But the next time your development team wants to test something risky on their  platform just boot them an idle node from their Virtual Environment , have them play around, test , screw up and don't worry , because it will only take you minutes to give them back what they started with, and after they are finished,  you can have your machines back ready to be used for another service.</P
><P
>openQRM is heading the good direction to manage a reproducible Infrastructure from an end user perspective.</P
><P
></P
><P
>As openQRM has support for non Linux platforms,  even integration with Full virtualisation is among the possibilities for future versions.</P
