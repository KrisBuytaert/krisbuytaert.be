Last year during assembly (Asm'94 that was..) we had the idea to
organise a bbq a couple of weeks afterwards.  Since none of us had
the time or the place to organise this event it was delayed for the next
year.  So 23/9/95 it finally was time for the event of the year !
The BBQ was held at Uncle Bob's place because we had lot's of place there
for everybody.  From The Natives Uncle Bob, Emperor, Purple Zebra,
Balex-T and me were already there so we were waiting for the first people
to arrive. Around 1500 the first showed up. Electron/Pure was the first
to arrive. Imagine came with 5 people .. Antonionize, Spiritual Steven, Pluto Boy
and 2 others whoms names I don't rememberr :(<br>
Soon after them Doctor K-os and ByteMare (the author of the Belgian Scene
Report) arrived.  This was actually the second event in the Belgian scene
this year, so for most of us it was over half a year since we had seen
eahother (most of the scene does not go to lot's of foreign parties as I do..)
and we had lot's of things to discuss, new groups, new projects, 3D engines,
Deep Freezer,Knight,Speed Freak and Venior (the Fuel & S!P crew)
also showed up...<br>
We had to pick up Model 3000/ Pure and Andr0meda/Insecabilis, at the busstop
and Tom Verbeure/ Synergy Design,  The Orme/Azure Sky, and Gekke Eekhoorn
arrived alone..<br>
During the evening Fuel showed a piece of code that was meant to be
the layout for a Belgian scene mag ..  There was enough food for
everybody.. and enough drinks also.  For some people there obviously was
too much because they were not able to go out anymore...
At the end of the evening Tasmaniac and Evil Batman arrived also...
The Majority of the 'bigger' flemish groups was there.  Too bad none of
the Walloon groups showed up ...
<p>
The result of this Barbeque was that one member of Imagine was almost
kicked because he couldn't drink as good as the others, and that Knight/Fuel,
was not acceppted in Imagine for the same reason.
<p>
Around 2300 the remainder of us (Purple Zebra, Uncle Bob, Emperor, Pluto Boy,
Antonionize, Gekke Eekhorn, Model 3000 and me) the rest was too drunk
or afraid of their girlfriends, or mummies.
<p>
There were no compo's an no releases, just fun and meeting each other..
something we should try to do more in  the scene..
