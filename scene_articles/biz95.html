Well here we are again with yet another party report, this time
it's 3 days after the third dutch party I visited this year.
Bizarre'95 held 9-10 september in Etten-Leur , The Netherlands.
<p>

As from our group nobody wanted to come with me I simply slept
till 11 o'clock while the party started at 10 ... eheh.. I took a
nice long bath and started to pack the car.  After dinner I left for
Holland. Uncle Bob had promised me to do a 4kb intro and he also
was going to make some dia's.  But he didn't show up so I didn't have
any of them. :( It took me about 35 mins to drive to Etten-Leur and then
again 15 mins to find the party place. (I didn't find the station fast
enough..) Well.. I enterred the party place where there was obviously
too much light.. You couldn't see shit on the bigscreen.
<br>
Well.. I was looking around a bit, looking for a place to put my equipment,
while I noticed AcCesS/Antares and his friends from the Wired organisation,
while I was talking to them Ben Hurry/Fuel jumped on my back.  Actually
I didn't expect to see him there cause on thursday he had told nobody
from our class was coming to Bizarre so he obviously had changed his idea,
seems like the belgian scene is getting a bit more active, most of the
people that didn't have exams anymore showed up.  (That's only 15 people
'cause the probably had exams.) I decided to set up my equipment next
to the Fuel guys 'caus they had some place left right in front of
the bigscreen which suited my needs perfectly ;-)<br>
After I had unpacked all my stuff I came to the conclusion I had
left all my food and drinks at home.  Because I didn't have that much
dutch money left in my pocket I decided to drive back home to get
everything.  Since it was only 35 minutes driving it wasn't that bad
and probably cheaper than buying my food at the party place.<br>
I hope there was no 'mareesjosee' somewhere wathing my car 'cause I didn't
knew that you can only drive 80 Km/hr on the dutch roads, i thought it
was rather like 130-140 <g>... well.. It took me about 1h15 mins to go
home and get back  to the party place.  Too bad Uncle Bob wasn't home yet
'caus he'd have made a really good chance on winning the 4kb intro compo.
<p>
I finally was back there... the party could start for sure now.
I was really surprised that almost nobody had seen demos like Stars or Juice
or heard Catch that Goblin ... it seems like most of the people didn't have
the time yet to check out the Assembly releases.  There was a nice party
network which had some directories on it with Asm stuff... about 10 Mb
at first.. after I had filled it up we had about 60 Mb ouf Assembly stuf
on it which I think is a rather small collection :((
<p>

Because you couldn't see shit on the bigscreen I decided to use it myselve.
I had a nice diaprojector with me and some empty dia's where I could write
on (yeah.. I got the idea from EMF during Asm, but if it isn't allowed to
use someonelse idea you should all stop coding 3D... and I am crediting them
now ! .) so I started advertising the Wired party on the
bigscreen.  It didn't took long until some organiser called Dusty (he
should change his handle asap 'cause the one and only Dusty is from
Japotek)  came to tell me he couldn't see the screen anymore (Which screen ??)
I had to remove my advertisments and find some other place.  After a couple
of hours looking for a nice spot I found out I had some space left
next to the bigscreen.  I think my slides even had more people watching than
the bigscreen itselve which of course was the whole idea behind it 'cause
everybody is obliged to come to Wired'95
<p>
At that moment we knew only 4-5 demos were going to be published,
the one from The Clan, Success, 2 from the Kip Brigade and the one
from Massive.  As I was walking around with Darkness we asked Rogue/Logic
Design what they were planning, he told us with a big smile on his face
that he wasn't planning anything, off course the big smile showed that
he was lying.  While talking to him he suddenly told us he had just
finished the music for the demo and that now they were doing the timing for
it. Oops... he had said something too much ... eheh...
<p>
So the big screen sucked... it also seemd that there were some problems
with a TSR they had to load to project vga gfx to the bigscreen, that
TSR also slowed down the computer :((  Thus SuccesS had a problem with
their timing ...  I found out Pure had also send 2 fellow belgian dudes..
but they were hiding somewhere on the last row far away from the other
Belgians.  Anyway.. while I was discussing with The Rew and Nix where
Darkness was staying he enterred the party places. (If you talk about
the devil you see his tail <g>...)  so the whole active Belgian scene had
arrived.  The Music compo wasn't that special, since the Rew and Mig
were the only top musicians around it  was rather sure that they would
take first and second place.  The Rew was almost disqualified because he
had enterred an .exe in stead of a .xm . so he had to convert his .ptm to
as he stated some unknown format called .xm in order to enter the competition.
Mig even enterred with a one year old tune and came second.
<p>

One nice feature was the videoroom where they were showing really good
videos I went watching Stargate togehter with Darkness... It obviously
shows you have to fight against your gods and dominators, because Future
Crew is almost dead it would be unfair to fight them, but we can still
fight Jmagic <g>...
<p>
Too bad they had the 4kb intro compo during this movie , but It
wasn't that good..  only the 4kb intro from Laserdance / Nostalgia
was rather good.. and there were only 3 entries ...
Neither was the gfx compo that good.. only the entry from Contrast
was really good.. (check out Partypig.lbm).
<p>
The 64kb intro compo was held in the main hall on the lousy bigscreen.
You couldn't see shit on it.. In my opinion only the top 3 was
worth showing on the screen... maybe some others I haven't seen yet
also but you have to blame the organisers I would have seen them all
if the screen was good.
<p>
Luckily they decided to do the democompo in the dark video room where
they would have some better quality.  Now it seemed that in order to
get rid of the slowdown caused by the TSR they were going to use a
Pentium 90 for the competion.  This caused off course that the Demo from
Massive and Logic Design didn't work immediatly.  But everything was
fixed fast enough.  It was time to find all the releases and put them
on the network.  Voting and waiting for the results.  You can read
the partly results below.  I think there is not that much discussion
possible about them .. at least not compared to last year.
<p>

My final conclusion is that this year's bizarre was a bit better than
the one from last year.  Though... Wired will be better for sure <g>...
