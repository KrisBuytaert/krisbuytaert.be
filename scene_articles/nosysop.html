<h4>Being a Sysop </h4>
<p>
A couple of weeks ago there was some noise on comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos,
the usenet newsgroup where a bunch of scene people have some chat but
are mostly disturbed by some idiots who think demos are previews of games.
<p>
Anyway someone came up with the idea only to let 'creative' people be part
of a jury.  This meant only coders, gfx artist, and musician.
Nobody else would be allowed to vote for a compo.  Now that would exclude
us sysops from the votings why we have acutally one of the most important
functions in your scene. Zteel / Diffusion started a discussion on that
matter in wich I happily assisted him.
<p>
Most of us sysops are part of a group (some even of more groups).
Some of us are gfx artist, musicans or coders that now have not time
anymore to do their original tasks.  As for myselve I coded the first
intro for the Natives (in that time CIA) (or was it the second) and
then I started running the board, organising the group etc I haven't got
time anymore to code so I'll leave that to the guys who have more time
to do it.  Zteel told me he did some graphics in the past.  Tasmaniac
is still busy coding and it wouldn't suprise me if Gandalf, Drain, Brian,
Pfusuus, Disperin ,Royal and lots of other sysops also have the same
problem.
<p>
Most of the time we Organise one or more groups. Which means we probably
know what tasks we are giving to the coders, and that we know what
we are talking about.<br>
WE have to spread all the releases and check everything, while checking
we see almost all the releases that YOU have made.  Most of the coders
just grab some things from a board/ftp site and watch them.. We have
to see them all (which is off course impossible).  So we can compare
the things we have seen probably a bit better.
<p>
Our most important task is to get all the releases fast enough, and
that's something you don't realise.  Where did you get this issue of
Impobia ?? 3 possibilities .. <ul><li> On disk from a friend
                              <li> From an ftp site
                              <li> From a bbs
	</ul>
If you got it from a friend, where did he get it ?? (2) or (3) ??
And when it's on a ftp site or bbs the sysop overthere had to make sure
it worked and that it was in the right directory so that you could
easily find it.  Maybe you don't know but an ftpserver also has a sysop
(possibly even more) but they are mostly not so social as the sysops
of a bbs.  So every file has to pass through a sysops hands.
<p>
If we weren't there... where would you be... Imagine no sysops.
You would be writing tons of letter to people asking for their latest
release.  Right I have to admit.. mail swapping is fun sometimes.. but
if it's the only way of communicating with eachother.
<p>
We sysops also carry the networks like GSN,DGI and CMN you'd like to read
everymorning in stead of your local paper.  We spent lot's of money
getting those nets abroad.
<p>
For me it's quite simple.. no sysops = no scene
<p>
So just think about us when you make rules about voting or when
you think about releasing that old 254Mb Animation you just made.
<p>
Greetings to all my collegues out there in the hard world... Keep up
the good work... only the best will survive !
