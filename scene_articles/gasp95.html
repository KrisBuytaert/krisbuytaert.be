Welcome again folks, this is the GASP 1995 Party report.
Gasp took place in Montpellier (that's in the South of France,
Disperin : NOT IN POLAND!) from friday the 11th of august till tuesday the
15th of august.  Almost exactly the same dates as Assembly'95
(Assembly'95 started and ended one day earlier).  But Gasp was mainly
an Amiga scene party, organised by Eremation and Dreamdealers.
The Entrance price (195FF) was a bit less than the entrance price
you had to pay at Assembly but more than most of the small parties
I visit, except that at GASP girls could get in for free...
<p>
Nothing special to tell about the party place except that the
Mc.Donalds was really close as stated in the invitation
and probably better than Carrols and you also easily go to the
beach.
<p>
Well.. the party itselve featured lot's of compos... the main
event was off course the Amiga Demo compo..., there also was
an Amiga 40kb intro, gfx compo, music compo, PC Demo and
Falcon Demo Compo, some surpise compos (which e.g. the
Assembly party didn't had..) and also Raytraced anim compo,
and Wild compo.  There ought to be lot's of game compo's like
Fears (which seems to be a doom clone on Amiga from Bomb, that
should be available by now, eheh... and we are still waiting
for Quake that was already announced before last year's assembly)
<p>
Now there was also a separate video room where you could watch some nice
recent movies 24h a day.  It seems like all better parties have this
feature.  (Wired'94, The Party'94, Bizarre'95) and some others lack of
this nice feature e.g. Assembly, Sih, and some others I forget...
<p>
Now some words about the PC Democompo.  As I missed the event I've only
found two demos yet.  The first one (and winning one) is from Eclipse and
it's called Lisa, now lisa ought to be enterring the Sih'95 party but for
some strange reason it didn't work on the organisers computer, Eclipse
first thought that it was because of the GusMax they had installed but
Aap/Acme asked to use my Gusmax to test it and it ran fine on my machine.
Now after the Sih'95 some people spreaded the Lisa that didn't compete in
the competition, simply because they didn't know that it wasn't released
yet and they found it on some harddisk.  (It was on the organisers server
for about 5 mins and I guess that was already enough to be spread :(()
It's too bad such things happen.  It seems like Lisa ran fine
on the machine they used at Gasp 'cause it won the compo there.
Second there was the demo from Distrosion, which is also quite nice,
no magnificent 3D routines, but a nice demo with lot's of nice
effects.    It's too bad there were not more demos for this compo.
Probably the main reason for this is that both Nooon and Realtech
had set their mind on Assembly where they scored 1st and 3rd place.
Next there was the Saturn 3 party which was announced but cancelled
afterwards.  Well I guess all you french groups know that you are obliged
to come to Wired'95 with your superb productions.  Show the world
that you can do better ;-)
<p>
I think the organisation should think about the things I've
written down here if they want more competitors in the future.
<p>
Well last but not least I think I have to tell you guys the truth,
I haven't been to Gasp 'cause I was at Assembly during the same time,
though I didn't ly a single word in this party report <g>..
