It was the year 1995, X-mas was just over, it was cold outside
(hmm.. are friends electric ??) 4:00 am, december 27th I was still awake,
quite logic since Unlce Bob's was to pick me up around that time.  They were
five minutes too late, but hey we were in time in Antwerp to pick up
Purple Zebra, Emperor, Pointer/Digital House and Msk/Tragedy.
From Antwerp we travelled to Breda where we were going to join the
New Order bustrip to Fredericia.   Fredericia is a place somewhere in
Denmark you know, and in Denmark people have the habit to organise a party
each year around the same time between X-mas and New Year.
<p>
Well, first we planned to join a Belgian bustrip, but since not enough
dudes showed up to come along and pay the bus we had to find some
other way of transportation and since Breda is just 45 minutes drive from
Antwerp it was even better to join the dutch bustrip.  Around 6:00 am
the bus left in Breda.  We had to pick up Nostalgia and Massive and some
other fellows in Utrecht and then we could go straigt to the partyplace.
<p>
Jeez.. those bustrips take long.. but no problem.  We had our friends,
our movies (Speed, The Mask, Revolution Man, and some others) and our
equipment.   After a really long drive we finally arrived the party place.
<p>
When we enterred the party place the party was already busy for about 8 hours
and we had missed the deadline for the 4 Channel Music competition which
was a disappointment for some of the people that had joined the trip.
One big hall , around the same size as Asm'94 , that is bigger than Asm'95
but smaller than Tp'94.  It was quite good filled but there were 2
big problems, the first one were two big cabins that were almost right
in front of the bigscreen.  All the people on the right side had to move
to see the big screen.  The second one was that you coulnd't hear the
music when you were in the back, e.g. it took me over half an hour to
find out that the music competition was busy, and during the music compo
we couldn't hear a thing because of the Rave concert going on in the
Sleeping Hall.  Can you imagine that .. the Rave concert .. lot's
of noice, in a sleeping hall ??   Right.. it seemed like they originally
had another hall for sleeping but there were some problems with the people
they hired the building from. Acutally it was no problem for me since
I din't plan on sleeping.  Well.. as every year the food was available
24/24 but expensive. The Hamburgers were cold (and worse than last year)
<p>
Party time is meeting people, meeting people is getting new rumours and
news.  Like there is .. nah check out the front new section somewhere
else in this diskmag ;-) Some people I certainly didn't expect to meet
was the other part of Synergy Design, you never know where you're going
to meet these guys next time.  But this time they were a complete
surprise, specially since we finally managed to release our music disk.
<p>
Well.. time for some demo compo's then.. the gfx compo was showed twice,
which is good.. but the second time they showed more.. obiously some
disk got lost and were found back.
<p>

The intro and demo competitions where way under level.  Not one single intro
could catch my attention.  None of them was worth winning.
Luckily there were about 3 good demos 'cause al the rest was also way
too average .. what's happening to the scene.. are we getting tired,
withouth inspiration ?? Are we at the top of our power ??
Damn guys be creative.. make something new, better.. I hope Mekka, The
Gathering and X will give us some new demo's to talk about.
<p>
Ok.. about the compo's then .. the organisation screwed them up by 'loosing'
some of the disks.  It looked like they were ignoring everbody who was
speaking dutch.  Acme, Logic Design and Nostalgia's demo's where lost and
disqualified ..same with the fast intro from The Kip Brigade.. did they
lose them or did they confuse dutch with french while they had orders
to ignore al French groups for the Chirac scandal <NOT>
<p>
Now to The Party V and money earning !
I has been sayed that the party was too fucking commercial,
even the organisers say so
<p>

Imagine a main organizer receiving more than 40.000 dkr, do you think
that he did it for the money, or was the extra money just not worth
thinking of?

(Now imagine 3-4 main organizers, and 50 other organizers being paid
a minor amount for the work, still not for the money?)

I don't know about you guys, but when we start to pay people a real salery
for their work, I'm in doubt. When you pay the amount as above, then I'd
say it  was for the money. And thats speaking as a party organizer myself.

Mc Donnalds commercials during the competitions ??  Jeez.. even the
party T-Shirt had commercials on it.. Smarties,
In the Suriprise competition you had to have some in your intro somewhere.
Jeez this sucks.. I wonder why I'm telling you guys al this.. I'm probably
the 5th who's writing the same in this issue.
<p>
Emf/Plant got 8000 DKK and a Pentium-75mhz, 1G HD, 4XCDROM,crappy
soundcard,14 inch monitor, Keyboard, Mouse, ATI MACH 64 2MB gfx-card
etc. at the party-place. That is way better than Assembly 95, from
which nobody has received prizes.  As you might have heard almost nobody
got his money from Assembly'95 that's why the commercial shit had to be
cancelled this year (or did they found enough money afterall ??
Ok they got their money.. but was it really worth al the Commercials ??
I think nope..
<p>
Some food stuff .. the hamburgers were way to cold, the pizza's to small
the drinks to expensive, and they were almost always out of spaghetti.
The city was to far from the party place to go and find some food if you
wanted to (Herning was way better)
<p>

Oki.. I'm tired complaining about The Party.. just one final thing I'd like
to mention.  Almost none of the Dutch groups plan to go back next year.
They even plan to do a new party at the same time : TakeOver'96
but that's not sure yet.. we'll see what the future brings.
Back to non commercial and smaller parties.
<p>
cya around..
