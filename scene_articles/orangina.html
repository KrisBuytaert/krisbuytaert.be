<h4>An interview with Der Flippo from Orangina
</h4>
<br><font color="#ff00aa">K: Konijn/Konijn Diezijn
<br><font color="#aa00ff">DF:  Der Flippo/Orangina
<p>
<br><font color="#ff00aa">K: Let's start straight away with the traditional "Tell us some more about
the who's and what's in your group"...

<br><font color="#aa00ff">DF:  Well, we started off really small but nowadays we are 91, a really
impressive number I'd say.  Frankly, to be honest, our 23 coders are one and 
the same person, but that's only because they all use the same handle, which
makes it difficult to keep them apart.  On the other hand, it's very handy
for making up the credits-list in a production: we can use the same line in the
scroller 23 times.  The rest of the team actually consists of 62 mail-traders
(which also have the same handle, so one P.O. Box is enough for all of them -
yes, we're quite up to date in economics when it comes to business in
Orangina).  The final member is me, Der Flippo: I'm more like the local
graphician who's solely achievements in the scene consist of eating an awful
lot of ravioli at parties I never attend.

<br><font color="#ff00aa">K: Hmmm, a pretty impressive list indeed.  From the above, I can conclude
that the economic principle is very important for Orangina.  Could this
perhaps be the reason why your group seems to release the same demo for over
4 years, just like Valhalla?  

<br><font color="#aa00ff">DF:  Actually, I would call this question "Bull's eye", you're very right indeed.
Speaking economically, what our main sysop Lord AMD tries to achieve here is
a superb filling up of his BBS by copying our only release a zillion times
all over his harddisk and then, each time we get noticed that a new party
has been held, changing the date-stamp of one of these copies to that
actual date and putting that file in the "incoming" directory.  Right now,
we're working on a pointer-system to optimize this way of releasing even
more.  The idea is to save disk-space by only having one copy of the demo
on the harddisk and creating a bunch of pointers to this file.  These pointers
will also have a date-stamp, I guess you'll get the point by now!?

<br><font color="#ff00aa">K: Very innovative, indeed...  And as always, it's Imphobia who has the
honour of presenting this breakthrough in scene-management for the first
time to the readers out there.  Now, let's change the subject to something
more personal.  Who is the real you?  I mean, we all know Der Flippo as a
scene elitist, but who is the actual person hiding behind this mask?

<br><font color="#aa00ff">DF:  Well, it's kinda hard to talk about myself this way, but we can 
always give it a try, can't we?  So, my real name is Hieronymous and my
hobbies are playing Doom and Descent, behaving like a cactus when a girl
is within ninety feet range and ofcourse keeping Ornagina one demo-copy
ahead of Valhalla.  Never mind, this is all rather boring but then again,
I'm a rather boring person.  

<br><font color="#ff00aa">K: Hmmm, this is all very, very interesting indeed.  It's always nice to
see that there is a real person with real feelings behind the scene-o-matic
robots most of us are.  Now, on to something which is keeping half of the
lamer world busy: where the schnock is Future Crew?  Rumours are that they
were abducted by aliens but common sense can pretty sure see the influence
of the ever popular series "The X-Files" or "Outer Limits" here.  However,
you are said to be a person who knows what has actually happened to these
guys, sooooo (*grin please grin*)...?

<br><font color="#aa00ff">DF:  I see you got to the right person and as far as I am concerned, I can
guarantee you that all rumours can be denied without hesitation.  Alien
abduction of FC is totally out of the question, everybody should know by
know that the aliens preferred TRSI members anyway - that's why Irata has
always been late with everything, his brain was periodically sucked empty
by the little green men of Proxima Centauri.  No, the real truth can now
be revealed and is nothing more or less than the fact that they are simply
bored of winning every compo they participate in, although all of their
routines were coded on a ZX81 during a three hours session back in the 
summer of 1492, right after they helped Columbus discover America.

<br><font color="#ff00aa">K: And you think they'll never do a demo again, just because of this?

<br><font color="#aa00ff">DF:  Well, Psi told me that his last routine (15.057.391 lines of pure
hex stuff) will be released somewhere in the seventeenth millennium,
when they feel the time is right to show the world once more that they
are the absolute cream of the PC scene.

<br><font color="#ff00aa">K: Strange, I've always thought that time was left.  Never mind, in the
meantime we'll see some butt-kicking demos from Nooon, Complex and, last but
not least, Orangina?

<br><font color="#aa00ff">DF:  Well, actually: NO!  Moby and Ra have left Nooon to form Afternoohoohoon
and Complex is more or less ex-Compl nowadays.  And as for Orangina, it'll
be the regular party releases as ever.  So, at least WE are doing something
for the scene, giving it a few new bytes to download every now and then.
Of course, once the phonelines have become cheap enough for every lamer to
afford these downloads from our absolutely eeleaaaat boards, we'll have to
find other ways to drain the money out of these annoying guys.  In fact, I
have been thinking lately about how this very fundamental problem can be
solved and I have come up with the utterly brilliant idea of doing this
throwing game with collectible CD-ROMs, I'm even thinking of lending my name
to this game.  After all, I invented it, so I deserve part - if not most -
of the fame.  One day, it will be as popular as Magic, or even more so.

<br><font color="#ff00aa">K: That's the hammer on the nail right there for you, matey.  Indeed,
Magic has been said to be sickening our oh so dear scene for the last couple
of months.  How can a bunch of techno freaks go wild completely on a stupid
card game?

<br><font color="#aa00ff">DF:  It remains a mistery, Konijn, even to the illuminatus I am.  
Nevertheless, I have been searching for a psychological reason behind all
this raving and going bananas but up to now, it all remains very dark,
even after dark.  Perhaps we could burn the cards?  And the players?
Naaah, maybe it's best if we just ignore them, put our heads in the sand,
ya know, it's what we're really good at after practising all these years
and it even seems to help...

<br><font color="#ff00aa">K: Another thing that's on the lips of most non-sceners ('cos this mag is
also read by people who are not active in our little Eden): most die-hard
sceners are nerds an sich, nerds pro forma and nerds for the art of
nerdship itself.  As such, the existence of the opposite sex - for most
sceners this is the female sex - seems to be a miracle to these guys,
so the question arises: does Der Flippo has someone to care for?

<br><font color="#aa00ff">DF:  It should be clear for all readers here that indeed I am the happy and
lucky posessor of wat we call "a la scene" a "nice chick".  She's available
on several ftp-sites in all kinds of colours, sizes and formats.  Surf the
net, start up a virtual relationship I always say.  Of course, being one of
the only girls intruded into the scene-life, she has been the girlfriend of
an enourmous amount of scene elitists, but as for now, she's entirely and
virtually mine.  As you can see, I must be one of the happiest sceners in 
the entire world at this time.

<br><font color="#ff00aa">K: Well, what else can I say?  It has been a real pleasure to be able to 
talk a few minutes with you and I am sure all your fellow scene-members
will be glad to learn a bit more about the "real" you.  Thank you for your
time and see you on some BBS at the next release of yet another faboulous
Orangina demo.  Ciao!!
