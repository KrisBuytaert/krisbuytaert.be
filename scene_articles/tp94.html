(General Notice... parts of this article have been written
at the party place during the compos, other parts afterwards..
that's why there will be some strange and complex sentences in it)
</font type>

My fourth and last party this year (unless... ;-))
I've been to Bizarre '94, Assembly '94, Wired '94 and now
we are here present at The Party '94
<p>
We decided to come to this party about 4,5 months ago at Assembly.
Tasmanaic said we could go with a small bus that he was going to hire
at first it was a Hypernova / The Natives bus but since only
2 people from Hypernova and only me from The Natives could come along
due to some exams etc.  Some other groups also joined.
We travelled with a small truck full of equipment and one car
The complete list : Tasmaniac/Hypernova (& Acid), Herr Cichlid/
Hypernova, Hall9000/$PA$PC, Binary Slave/$PA$PC, X-Bow/Traxx and
me Sleeping Dog/The Natives.  There were also some other belgian fellows
coming with the Train , Blue Adonis/Traxx, Thunderbolt/Traxx,
Rex Nebular/Traxx, another car was filled with Lord Cyrix/All The Groups
You ever wanted do Kill (because they are too big..),Venior/AD and
Jumping Jack Flash/AD
<p>
We arrived after a 11 hour car trip at the party place around
01:00 on Tuesday they.  We set up all our equipment and started
to work.  Around 10-11 o'clock the hall starts to fill itselve.
More and more groups come in and find their places, install their
equipment and try to make as much noise as possible.
<p>
We start for our first round and find out there is nobody known yet,
suddenly we hear some people talking a strange language called
Flemish a couple of Amiga freaks from Tragedy.. really nice crew to
hang out with...
<p>
I'm back settle here and there's the first local kiddy, asking Tasmaniac
'Hi, Can I copy your registered version of Doom II ?'
Getta hell outa here... why do people even allow those kids ??
Luckyly enough it was also the last one we saw... Right for me
to copy some brand new things as Descent etc but no fucking
warez at parties !!
<p>
It's 9 O'clock... one hour too late... the big screen shows...
Let's follow the screen  you can see my opinion in the last colums
with some additional info i wrote, remember, this was written
realtime...

shit is...
<br>

<i>22:00 The Amiga Intro Compo (Probably going to be as shitty as .. )
</i>

Only 25 contributions have ben shozeen...
<br>

I don't feel like writing down all the Amiga info since I think
that most of the people reading this mag are more interrested in the
PC Compos and not in some Amiga Intro showing us Intel Outside
<p>
Let's face it we are not yelling Amiga suxxx amiga suxxx amiga suxx
we are the grown ups... The Amiga is the childisch part of the Scene
<p>

<i>23:00  The C64 Demo Competition</i>

 4. Courtesy of Sovjet    Wrath
</pre>
 Lost the counting and the rest also... no time to write the
 rest of the C64 intro...  anyway... I liked them more at
 Assembly '94
<br>
But the best one was from Access Denied... kind of strange...
I thougt AD was a PC group but it seems like there is some other also..
<p>

Sound Equipment suxxxx too many basses...  Hmm lots of other things
I saw some people writing their comments for the organisation telling
the whole thing was major sucking even worse than last year. (Dunno
I can't compare it to last year..
<p>

11. Lethal Display 5     Bonzai                         +
The second time this demo crashes... seems like those guys don't
really know how to handle a 80XXX :-(
Is it a bug ?? or is it the coding  Or is it Gore's PC ?? Sounds like
the most obvious thing.. :(
12. Zero                 A-Men                          -
13. Explicit Coding      Mystic Bytes

15. No                   Nooon                          +++++++++++++     1

one of the best in Europe...
16. Zero Pulse           The Nuclear Threath            ----

My ears are beeping when the fucked up music system is active..
It isn't worth a thing... You only hear the low sounds and
nothing else..
<p>
The GfX Card that is used by the organisation Suxxx  it doesn't
work with about 20% or the Demos which is too much..
<p>
Well it's almost the end of the Party... still to come :
Amiga Demo which I won't even mention... you can read my comments
about the Amiga Intro and they are exactly the same here..
<p>
And then the WILD Compo... this is really wild... mostly some
gread animations, nothing worth calling a Demo but whathever..
Then we have the large A4000 section .. possibly some of the ones that
have been stolen :(
<br>
Yes... this is the first party where I hear so many times that something
has been stolen. All right some things at Assembly but overhere
it's almost impossible about 4 A4000's, some 486's lots and lots of CD's
I really hate the attitude of those assholls that do this...
<p>
Well the worst thing I remember from this compo was an A4000 demo showing
a girl walking on a stage... then the msg... this can't be done on a PC.
Neither on any plain other system withouth an MPEG card !
<p>
There was even a brilliant guy who took the invitation for real and used his
VIC20 ... No Silicon Graphics enterred the compo.. I'll bring mine next year.
(That is if i earn enough writing articles for free ;)))
<p>
Well there are some people that I still haven't found here :
<p>
Otto Chrons , Kapsu / Epical , Disperin, Daneel / Outlaws FX
etc etc.
<br>
But I found most of my contacts...
<p>
The compo's are over we have send Tasmaniac and X-Bow to their sleeping
places so that we can leave tomorrow morning for a long trip back
to Belgium.    It's time to find some party releases.
<p>
Well I guess everybody already read the notes about the mixup between
the first and the second demo showtime, so I'm not writing about that.
Neither am I going to publish the results here... partly because
I fell asleep during the announcement of the Results but hey..
you know who won !
<p>
During a long trip back to home we start brainstorming about some
new ideas... 3 of them are being worked out ... you will hear some
things about them soon... (demo release at Bizarre (if that is going
to be held again..), a new big Belgian group, and a Scene Album.
<p>
I guess that's all for today... I hope I'm not to late for the Imphobia
issue that is coming out this week
