A couple of years ago therre was a television serie called 'Mother why do
we live' the obvious answer was 'to booze son'  ... Well that actually
was the correct answer.  So why do we stay in such a non organised
thing where only male humans hang out ??
<p>

Well there is such a thing as fame... when you start as a beginner in
the scene you don't know anybody, you look up to the big names you want to
meet them... you want to be among them... you want to be best friends
with some famouse people... you want to make a production better than
them.. you want other people to look up to you... you want to see your
name in the charts...
<p>

So you try to climb up the stairs , go to parties... hang around..
have phun... afterall you win some parties since it's really simple
to code a production better than all demos before, afteral you are
a genius.  So after a couple of years on the top when you've won
everything, you go to your xx'th party, you are in for 5 minutes and
everybody is hanging round your neck asking wether you are going to
enter the competition or not.. 'cause if you are... they might as
well stop working on their production... so you say no.. hide in a
quiet corner and try not to tell anybody that you actually have a demo
finished.  Then 5 minutes before the deadline you go to the information
desk and deliver your demo.  Off course everybody is surprised to
see another astonishing demo from you guys... but hey .. it hangs ..
well.. since it's your group, they simply run it again... and again.
well it's not that important to have a working demo, as long as runs
perfect on your machine everything is all right.
<p>

The group partly leaves the scene but the name and the fame still
exist.  Lot's of rumours are spread that you are going to release another
astonishing production, off course you know better than that, no one
of you has got the time to code.. Though some of you still go to parties.
To hang out with their old friends, have lot's of fun and lot's of beer.
<p>

Afterall It comes down to just one single thing... while we are away
at parties, leaving our girlfriends at home alone it's just for one
single reason... we have an easy exuse to booze...

And remember...<br>

<br> It's better to be death and rememberd than Alive and Forgotten.</i>
