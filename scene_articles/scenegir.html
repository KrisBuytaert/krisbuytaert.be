Natives
<p>

Where ?? Where ?? What ? Huh... Where ????
<p>
Wives.. girlfriends.. sisters.. probably all the kind of girls we meet on
parties.<br>
First there was Lydya(Silent Voice / Black Design) she went with us to
Asm'94.. Then we met Zeugma, or as Subnormals so subnormally described
the Megababe from Melting Pot, she was almost the only girl at Wired'94
At the party some German girls sat next to us... actually their boyfriends
sat next to us while they were outside.<br>
While we were discussing what we missed on most of the parties Electron/Pure
had only one answer ... sex,sex,sex,sex... but off course you have to know
Electron to understand what he meant.<p>

It seems like almost no girl is interrested in computers, normally we see no
girls in computer business e.g. the first year of computer science at
University there was one girl... she gave up after the first week.
It seems like next year we'll have 2 girls.  That means 2 girls on a total
of 50 guys that are interrested in computers.  But that doesn't mean
they are interrested in the scene, cause the scene is also involved
with some heavy maths <g>.<p>

So most of the girls that show up at parties ar sisters or girlfriends(wives).
Sisters because they want to know what their brother is doing the whole
weekend or what their boyfriends are doing.  Another good example is Uncle
Bob's sister she's always hanging around on coding weekends, always wanting
to see the latest stuff, listening to her favourite Erik Stidell, she
even promised to come some parties... only the morning when we had to leave
she stayed home... afraid what we might do with her (and she is used to
lot's of things (ain't she Balex-T and Ben ??))
<p>
So In Belgium we have a couple of scene girls.. Tante Terry, Silent Voice,
Blue Adonis' wife etc... the situation is a bit in the Netherlands
they have Aap's Sister, Dope's Sister, a couple of girls in The Kip Brigade,
and their famous plastic doll.   They need it so badly that they even
have to write messages in NWO to find out who has it at the moment.
Everybody uses it... At Bizarre they even had it announced on the big screen.
someone had found the doll... off course it was The Rew who was looking
for it.
<p>
Are we a bunch of nerds ?? Do girls stay away on purpose ??
Nope real nerds sit home 24h a day hanging behind their screen recompling
their ultimate gifviewer and testing it with every single gif they can
find.  I wouldn't even dare looking at their screen or keyboard because
it's full of... well you know what i mean... They have never even heard of
a real woman...
<p>
Most of the people that are in the scene are copletely unlike this
description.  We go out every week multiple times, have (multiple) girlfriends.
Actually we don't care if there are no girls at parties 'cause they are
probably not the kind of girls we are looking for. (Except Zeugma then..
right Jeff ??) and oh yes... we watch The Real Thing twice a week for
the .... Off course there are some exceptions in the scene.. but hey...
we're not interrested in them aren't we ?
<p>
You have been hacking for to long when....
  ... you feel a woman's kiss in your neck and you think Priority Interrupt
