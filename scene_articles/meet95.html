Party Report from The Meeting '95 Lomme (Lille) France

Written by Sleeping Dog<p>

5 O'clock in the morning.. almost eveybody is asleep... Time to write
a party report... So far the most shocking thing i have seen is our own
4kb intro :(<p>

Since Purple Zebra and Emperor called thursday that they wouldn't
come to this meeting (actually they are missing nothing), there's only
Uncle Bob and me here from the Natives. I still don't understand
why I'm in France this weekend, almost everybody I'm speaking to is
from Belgium, which means that there actally is no northern french scene
exept some small groups that not even seem to know that some people from
their own country came 1st and 2nd at The Party.  So here is
the traditional list of groups I have seen here so far ..
The Natives(B>, Antarez(B), Realms(B>, Megabusters(F) Euphoria(B/F), Spa/Spc(B),
Synergy Design(B), Virtual Design(Germany), Les Coucacoucacous(F) ( I actually think
they invented their name when I asked it ;-) ), React(B) , Hypernova
(that is Herr Chichlid who dropped in on sunday), Pure (see my other article)
I don't think more than 100 ppl showed up at the party place.
<p>
I'm really happy we didn't leave on friday evening... i would have spoiled
my time here. When we came in on saturday morning there was almost an empty
hall..which didn't change afterwards... Uncle Bob and I installed ourselves
at a table that means 2 pc's and my hifi equipment (Sony STR-GX315) I turned
open my amplifier and woke up... actually a simple 150W were enough to
fill the WHOLE party place ... at a normal party you can hardly hear yourselve
when you put it on maximum.  It didn't take long till the organisation told
me that i could use it on maximum ... strange... normally they ask if
you want to turn down the volume, this time it was just the opposite.
So far for that... while i was busy finding my coax terminators in my luggage
(between a bunch of cables) Iceman/Euphoria, one of the organisers was
interrested in setting up a party network which we did asap. We were
in the party place for 1 hour, and the party network was running... that is
the coax one... there already was an UTP one running.
</P>


As far as I knew only Antarez was working on an Intro and no 4k intros had
been delivered so far.  So I said to Uncle Bob he had to start one which he
did. As on the most parties you meet some new people and the first guy to show up
was BlackNight from Germany. They were going to enter the music compo,
the intro compo and the 4k intro compo. That made the result rather easy
either they or we were going to win... (I thought).  And some guys from Gent
whom i had chatted with for a couple of hours also showed up... (really
cool to meet them...)<p>


The First Compo was being announced : Fast GFX Compo : draw an Elephant ;-)
I think it was at this time I saw Melting Pot entering the party Place..
at least the Megababe from Melting Pot ((C) Subnormals)  Things start
going fast now... Fast Rendering Compo : Render a Toy , Fast Music Compo
with given samples...  Now here my criticism woke up..  I'm not sure if it
happened but how can you check if it is composed real time ??
It's so easy to fix your patterns and complete module layout based on
some samples and then when you get the obliged samples just change the
instruments ! What's realtime about that ??  Anyway... the equipment
used to play the Fast Time music Compo was a GUS-Max with 512Kb Ram
attached to a Sony STR-GX315.. right... since the organisation didn't
really have any descent sound equipment they used mine..actually I don't know
what other people thought about it but it is good material but
I don't think it is really suited for these purposes anyway..there was one
problem with the only amiga contribution to the party... one of the 'given'
samples was damaged ... and so was the module, this meant no amiga entry...
<p>
Time for a Karaoke... nobody really liked it. except the organisation which
was singing french songs till I asked my equipment back <g>.
<p>
It was waiting for the other compos to start... first breakfast...
breakfast was ok.. but the afterwards there wasn't that much food
left :( actully no food left at al... and this was the first party
in years where i had no 'Toostjes' with me... so Retard Ed almost beat me
up for that one... (NOT), actually he was too busy watching Legend of the
Overkill and trying to fix some buggy routines... I spent the
whole night talking to (here come the fast greetings) Hall9000, Binary
Slave, Pom, Mikee Mouse (how are your eyes ??), Daneel Olivaw , Seyda,
Access, Tom Verbeure, Retard Ed ... and some other I'm forgetting.
(Daneel: when are you going to start that project of yours ?? I'm waiting)
<p>

Finally The Compo's thats why we're al here... isn't it ??  First of all..
the voting... it sucked... just take a piece of paper.. put your name on it
and dunno... I still don't know how it worked... probably 'caus I was to busy
connecting the amplifier to the compo pc and explaining on which channel
the Gus , Amiga was connected.
<p>
Music Compo , as usual there were some problems... there was a great module
in .ult format they tried to play it in Ultratracker but it didn't work
due to the mega old version of the Ultratracker so they postphoned
that modules to a later place but they kept it whith the same number,
that's why people didn't really know how to vote for it.  But those things
happen everywhere...  There weren't that much entries for the other compo's,
actually thc only compo you could call a compo was the 4k compo.., for the
64 there was one clear winner wich had a problem with the sound routines
(Antarez) and Euporia was the only one who had a 'Demo' Finished.
<p>
That was it for the compo's, not that interresting :(  Uncle Bob's father
was coming to pick us up so we had no time to loose.  It seemed like
we didn't have to wait that long for the results.  4K intro winner was us
and exeaqo the guys from Germany ... Maybe when I had voted we would have won
alone ! ;-))
<p>

During the drive back we slept... I came home and put al the things online
at my board... i called the organisation to see if they had some new info
and they didn't even have the results online yet... so far for a not good
organised party ... maybe next year it'll be beter...
<p>
