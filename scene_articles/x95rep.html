<h4>
X'95 Report by Sleeping Dog / The Natives
</h4>

/me back ;-) Time to write some things about one of the best parties
I've ever been to... maybe even The Best !  Saturn 3 was not held,
(hey guys... let us know when you finally are going to held that party !)
and  since I couldn't go to The Gathering due to some stupid exams, there
was only one solution for my acute party addiction : X'95.
<p>
First only Balex-T, Uncle Bob and me would go... no problem for one
car.  Then thursday morning I met Purple Zebra and Emperor on Irc.
They had told me they wouldn'c come with us 'caus it was too close
to their exams, but it seemed they had changed their mind.
It was possible to have 4 people in the back of the car , and to put
the other equipment in the trailer so everything was settled.
As I still had an exam on saturday morning.  I left for Berchem
where I would meet my father, Puz and Emperor now the old man came
up with the idea not to take 4 people in the back of the car (stupid him)
the only sollution was that one or two went by train.  We took
all their material in the car and we drove to my place where we had
to pick up my equipment, futher to Uncle Bob's little home to pick up
the rest of the material and of we were for a one and a half hour drive
to Utrecht.  Easy to find the party place so no problems.
<p>
We enterred the party place.  Actually it where a couple of small
places (even smaller than a usual class room).  But there was a nice
atmosphere.  We were in the same room as The Kip Brigade and Weird
Magic whom I knew from The Party and Tfl/Tdv whom we knew from Wired
there were also some other groups in there which I don't remember.
After the equipment was installed I went for my first tour.  I met
some good old friends from Nostalgia, Acme, Logic Design while I was
looking for a pc with AC on his led's.  (It was to difficult to look
for somebody with a different piece of skin at his nose).
<p>
Some people told me the food outside really tasted like shit so we
decided to go for the local McDonalds which was only 10 mins away..
Late that evening I bumped in to Darkness who had just arrived at the
pp.  I came to the conclusion that there were not even 10 people from
belgium at the party while the pp was almost in our backyard.
(3 or 4 people from TFL/TDV, 5 from The Natives, and Darkness)
WAKE UP Little country I know whe have lot's of groups out there
that have the potentional to do something but you all should wake
up and get out of your lazy chair !! Binary Slave, Tasmaniac,
Blue Adonis, Ghory, Spiritual Steven, Antarez, Seyda, Pom, Mickey,
Byron, Moebius etc : WAAKE UP .. Get your lazy crews alive and make
them work!  And make sure after the exams we meet at every possible party !
<p>
Well they had a nice system set up so that in every room you could follow
the compos on a tv monitor ... too bad there wasn't any sound from
those. The Gfx compo started. Not that good... there was only one
picture that made me look twice, a rip off from a picture presented
at Wired last year.  I ran to Darkness to verify my thoughts and he
told me I was right.  The C64 compo had a really good production in it.
I have only seen 3 C64 compos at parties so far but none of theme ever
showed me gouraudshading !   Some people where angry with the fact
that during the music compo the screen stayed on so you could
see the author, but that was not the main problem.  Both Acme
and Nostalgia used an executable module which also displayed gfx
during the playing, and some people started to argue that this wasn't
a intro or gfx compo but a music compo and that the jury might be
influenced by the pictures of those productions.  I read on the web
that some people think that's why Acme won the compo, I'm not
really sure about that...
<p>
Time for breakfast : Back to McDonalds (jeez.. this seems like a
commercial) In the way back we discussed the near future and Uncle Bob
even told me what was going to happen the next saturday evening.
<p>
Back to the compo's  Logic Design didn't enter the Demo compo but made
a short intro with the routines they had ready.  They won. Only one problem
they didn't release the intro yet.  This makes me think of the
thing that happened at Bizarre last year, they entered the Demo compo (and
became second) with a completely unfinished demo and never finished it
till after 3 months they spread a production with exactly the same name
(Prologue) but completely different (Rogue : Don't do that this time please)
<p>
Then the Demo's came.  I was astonished about the high quality of
most of the productions.  Although it seemed as a small party at first
Abstract Concepts and Acme really brought some World Top releases,
but maybe they should also consider 3D isn't the only thing you need.
<p>
I had a great time in Utrecht met a lot of new people (unfotunately
not enough) and probably I'll be back next year...
I hope I didn't put too much inside jokes in there that you guys don't
understand ... anyway.. that's why they're called inside jokes.
<p>
You'll find the results in an other article.
<p>
To all dutch guys cya somewhere in Holland..
