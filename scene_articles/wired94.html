Wired : 29-31/10/94  
</b><br>

It seems like my pc is lasting longer than 18 hours this time so I'm starting
to write a party report at Wired right now.  (I couldn't do this at Assembly
'cause my Hard Disk crashed after 18 hours.  
<p>
The party place is big enough for the party, there are 2 main rooms where
most of the groups have installed there equipment.  The second room is only
half filled with mostly Amiga and the other room with almost 100% PC.
Wired is once again a party that shows that PC is taking over. The 
projectionroom is a nice amphitheathre where you can lie back and enjoy the 
presented stuff.  And then there is also a good sleeping room.  It's quiet
and warm, what else do we need ?
<p>
So far we have had the welcome (about 1h45 min too late...). The Doom Compo
about which we can tell that it sucked.  The keycombinations of the game were
completely changed so that one had to adapt his playing style.  There was
no shifting available so you could not run.  (I'm still wondering how the 
organisation played the second level of Doom 2 withouth shifting.  (NOT!))
And the games were on way too slow machines withouth soundcards.
The big screen is what you can call 'The Perfect system' a really good screen
with some cool audio equipment.  No one can complain about it so far.
<p>
The first night they showed some cool demos, and 2 Cd-Movies , The Naked Gun
2,1/2 and Patriot Games.  It is now sunday morning (cool song by the Velvet
Underground) and we heard there are no money prizes (not really sure).
During the afternoon people had the chance
to come online at the big screen and present some new routines and stuff, 
but I didn't see anybody doing it.  So we saw the whole bunch of top demos
again. So far so good.  Tasmaniac/Hypernova
asked the organisers for the rules of the Suprise compo, about 2 hours
later (around 15h30) we got them : PC Only, Max 4Kb (how obvious), and based
on the word 'Wired'.   The Deadlines were set at 18h (also for the 4kb
intro).
<p>
You're probably interrested in which groups where at the Party Place.
Here comes a short list (I'll probably miss some of them because I can't
find out where everybody is sitting)  SPC (former $PA), HypernovA (incl one
ACiD member), Outlaws, Digital House, Distorsion,Isch Crew PC, Zuul, Imphobia
Cascada, The Natives (former Coders In Action), Synergy Design (they didn't
split, they are still alive and kicking , they even released an animation file),
TFS, Imagine, Radical, Acme, Zion, J&J Productions, SemteX, Antares (obvious),
Traxx, Black D-Zine, Melting Pot, Subnormals, Acme, Nostalgia, N-Factor,
Flamoots,and some others I forgot..
<p>
The Competitions should start in 15 min (after tree changes of the deadlines..)
so I'll try to find a good seat...
<p>
We're back the competions are over... now the less good part begins...
First off all the competitions started with de PC Demo Competitions,
normally the organisations should keep the best for last.  I
asked Access (organiser) if this was possible so that we could get
first music, then gfx etc and he was quite positive about it but it
seemed like the other organisers didn't like it that way do the competitions
started with the PC Demo Compo First.  There were 10 pc demos competing.
DSL, Imagine, HypernovA, TDV/TFL, DFM, TFS, SemteX (no music), ZUUL, N-Factor,
and Outlaws/PC released a Demo.   Because the demo from Outlaws did not run
properly the amiga modules were played.
Afterwards we had the GFX compo and the Music compos.  So the music compo
ended around 02:30 and only the people that were competinge were listening
to the modules.
<p>
The compos were over, time to catch the latest releases ans spread them.
The organisation didn't want to release anything.  Not the Mods, not the
intros, not the gfx.  Because they planned to release a CD with all the
stuff on it, like so many parties before have tried, but none have ever
succeeded.  So there was only one solution left :
Set up a network and release everything ourselves.  So we did, on
monday morning the whole network was set up and the groups that wanted
to release something joined it.  The result was that the organisation wanted
a copy of my hardisk ;-))
<p>
On normal demo party the only kind of music you hear is house or techno
at the wired party we were playing all kind off other music.  Finally
there was a prove that not all demofreaks are ravers.  We played everything
we wanted on the biggest system available : The Imagine music system.
<p>
Hmm... suppose I also have to write the results here ??
Lucky enough I released them before so I can just copy them into here...
<p>
It is a copy of the results that were written on the blackboard
by the organisation of Wired'94  It is possible that there are
writing mistakes.

I guess that I wrote enough bulshit to waste your time... I can only
advise you one thing now.  Get the Wired Party Report by Subnormals
and watch it.  It's only 5Mb ;-)

Final Note
<p>
Wired Update..
<br>

I just heard from one of the organisers of Wired '94 that
there are some difficulties with the 2 groups that Organised
the party this year.  Some groups would not have received their
prizes.  So it the First Wired is possibly going to be the last.
I hope this isn't true..
