<h4>Are parties getting worse every year ??</h4>


'95 was my 5 th year hanging around in the scene.. and my second year of
visiting lot's of parties.. probably it will stay they year where I visited
the highest number for a couple of years. 'cause while it now is already
april'96 and I haven't visited one single party yet :((  Although
I could have gone to Mekka and I should be going to X'96 next weekend.  
Though
exams are coming really close and I really need to pass them this year.
But that's not what this article is about.. it's more about how parties
get worse every year.  I think I can compare some of them like
the ones I both visited last year and the year before (that is Assembly,
Wired, Bizarre and The Party) and from what I read from other reports
by other party freaks like me.<p>

As you might have read before I , together with lot's of other people
really disliked TP5, unlike last year when I found it one of the best
parties ever. TP5 got more commercial and all went wrong.
Read more about in my other article <br>
Same with the other 'big' one.. Assembly, Last year it looked really 
huge, a great atmosphere and lot's of other events happening around.
This year it simply sucked, only reason why I might get back is to 
hang out in Helsinki and have fun for a couple of days, on the
other hand I might as wel go to Euskal and stay in Spain for a while.
<p>
Due tue some financial problems there even was a statement spread by
the Assembly organisation that Assembly'96 would not take place.
but it seems like they solved the problem after all..
<p>
Parties that are getting too big are impossible to organise, it takse a real
profesional team, a professional team has no feeling with the scene.  So 
the party looses atmosphere , the quality goes down and next year the party
simply sucks
<p>
On the other hand small parties Wired, X, Bizarre to name a few I visited 
are organised again by scene people who are
getting experienced in organising small parties and they become better 
and better.<br>
You don't need lots of money to organise a good party.  You just need
to get some good groups at your party.  Of course there will always
be people who complain about the food, about the music compo or about
not enough people being there, but thats something you will always have 
to deal with.<p>

Let's party on .. after the fucking exams...
