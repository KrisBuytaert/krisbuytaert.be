<h4>Interview with Big Jim/Valhalla</h4>

<font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  HI
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  Hi there... I think we can start right now ;-)
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Ok
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  So ... the best thing to do is start with the usual stuff... who are you.
.. what group are you in... what did you do before etc..
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Right... Big Jim (James Storer). I am in Valhalla and F.M. I'm 19 year
s old and I study Computer Science at Bradford University, England
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  Try this question... Where did you find your Handle... are you Big or did
 you think you were big when you started using it.. ;-)
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Haha!! Actually I've been using the handle for ages! I think since I w
as about 14....
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  What's the ida behind it... ??
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  At that age, I was very small compared to the average height, so it's
kind of a joke (though I'm about average heightt now!)
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  big_jim: and nowadays you also are one of the Biggest musicians in the Eu
ropean scene...
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  well.... thats the first time Ive heard anyones say that actually...:)
 I could think of a lot bigger names....
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sd: I would say that I am still way behind the likes of PM, Skaven, Me
llow-D and Jogeir Liljedahl, in terms of the standard of my music an being well
known :)
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  btw what's F.M actually... I think lots of people do know Valhalla by now
 but F.M might confuse them..
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sd: Ok
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Well, it has caused a lot of confusin since Valhalla realeased Fluid M
otion!!! but....
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  maybe you were behind on them at the Party but wat do we hear from them ?
? You are one of the most active musicians...
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  F.M. stands for Five Musicians.... it is a kind of music band comprisi
ng of Myself, Puprle Motion, Mellow-D, necros and basehead
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  big_jim: the 'top Five of the World ??
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sdog: Hehe.. well i dont know about that!!!
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  bigjim: it is true that those names show up high on almos every chart ...
 so...
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sdog: I would say Five freinds who appreciate each others music really
... it's just a way of doing some music 'together'... the main idea behind it is
 to to try and produce some co-operative works between us
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  bigjim: when did you actually start to work for Valhalla ?? The first thi
ng I saw from you guys was Visions Of Light..
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Yes.. V.O.L was first presented at ASM 94... I joined shortly after Pe
ripheral Vison was releases at TP 4
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Valhalla were formed in February of 94
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  Were you in F.M. before that already ??
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sd: No I wasnt. FM was only formed very recently. ABout a month or so
ago I think
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  What was for you the music where you actually made your break with ??
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  I mean... you must have started like anyone else... and became better.. a
nd better..
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Oh yes, that is certainly true... my first release was an entry in MC2
 - the rookie section - called Mindwash. it placed 40th!!!
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I would say my 'big break' in the scene was Hangover, I got a lot of p
raise for that, which really encouraged me
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Although, my break for me personally.. would have to be Cold Fear, whi
ch i wrote shortly after Mindwash... the difference in quality of those 2 songs
is unbeleivable
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  Did you release it on a compo or in between ?
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Hangover was just released after I wrote it. i just uploaded it to hor
net
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  What do you think if you compare your style of music to that of other com
posers... Is it different ??
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Hmmm... thats a toughie!
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I dont really know.. a lot of the stuff I write can be experimental...
 but the experiments don't alwayts work so they are left to lay around on my har
d disk :)
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  give it a try.;-)
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I am influenced a lot by other composers... for example the other memb
ers of FM an also Skaven who's music I really like...
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I would say that my my style is really based around strong melodies an
d chord sequences.
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  Jeez... you just grabbed my next question right out of my head... I plann
ed to ask you who your great examples were ;-)
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  A good point that I have been told about my music is that it is very m
emorable
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  Damn server ... still there ?
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I think so... If you want me to round off the answer, I would say that
 my style is really not that different to a lot of other composers, although i d
o have my own little ...
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  ...little trademarks :)
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  maybe you can now finnish the list of your big examples...
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  big examples?
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  people who inspired you... both in normal en computer music...
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Oh I see...
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Well In computer music terms I would have to say the other members of
F.M. and Skaven. Particularly Skaven. When i was beginning to track a lot , I sa
t down and analysed a lot of tracked music, to see exactly how particular sounds
 and effects were acheived
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  and in 'normal' music... (if we can make a that difference...)
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  In real terms... Hmmm.. I dont actually listen to an awful lot of tape
s and stuff. I dont have a CD player :(((((((((
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  So you don't have real favourite groups which  inspire you ??
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I guess the bands Nirvana, Faith no More, Therapy stick out as favouri
tes, and little traits of theirs may pop up now and then in my music...
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Alos, classical music inspires me too
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  also
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  little traits, do you think 'grunge' is more difficult to make on compute
r or didn't you try it out yet ?
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Well I havent really tried a grunge track! I did a dance mix of 'Smell
s Like Teen Spirit' (But then who hasnt!). When i say traits... I meant like cho
rd progressions, or samples
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  brb.....
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  back
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  do you think it's possible ?  Guitar music on computer i mean...
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Certainly... listen to Reflecter by Zodiak. Although it does use BIG s
amples!
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  you mentionned the word twice now... so I feel almost obliged to ask you.
.. where do you get your samples ;-)
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I think that it is possible to achive good sounding guitar music witho
ut using massive samples like that! It just takes a bit more hard work
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Right.. well I have to admit that the main source of my samples is cur
rently other composers mods :( (i know I'm gonna get slated for that!!)
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I am starting to do more and more of my own samples now though...
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  why should they not everybody has the amount of money to buy huge profess
ional equipment to sample... and why should you reinvent hot water (or resample
cool samples..)
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I get my own samples from tapes, borrowed synths and most of all, my g
uitars
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  using a Gravis ?? with ??
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sd: Quite, although using your own samples does make the song feel mor
e 'yours' if you know what I mean
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sd: Yes I use a Gravis (not a MAx) with only 512k of memory, which is
good in a way
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog : any particular software ?
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Yes I use .. shit forgot what its called!.. Goldwave!
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Although, if Psi of FC is reading this.. PLEASE make Digiplay for Gus
:) I always used to use that when i had my Sb
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  hehe ;-) I think there's one thing the readers also want to know... what
Tracker do you use .. and why do you use that one ?
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I always track using Screamtracker 3.2
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I use it because I like the interface more than anything. I dont like
using a mouse to track.. it slows me down
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Fast Tracker 2 has some excellent features, but I cant get used to sus
ing it becuase of the interface
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  We've been talking about almost everything of the musical part of you...
what do you plan in the future ??
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I would really like to do music for games. Ideally that would be my ca
reer. But very few people can make that their full time job.
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I would also like to make a CD.. I hear of all these people like Maelc
um & Lizrdking doing them, but I really wouldnt know how to start! I dont know i
f its any easier to get CDs pressed in the staes or over on the continet that in
 England.
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  Is there that much place for a .S3M composer in the game development ? Do
n't they use other types of music (don't kill me... I stopped playing games 2 ye
ars ago...)
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Well... it depends really. A lot of companys use midi music (I can com
pose midi stuff too :) but there are a lot more these days using tracked music I
 think.
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  lot more than in the past.. not a lot more that are using midi
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  than are using midi :)
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  So you scream out to all producers in the world you want to produce a CD
?
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Hehe... well yeah :) That would be very nice! If someone wants to put
up some offer :)
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  Don't you think that one of the major problems with putting your work on
CD is that there is no text in it ??  Just plain music..
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I don't really know, there's always the inlay card. i never really tho
ught about that before... it is nice to have messages and greets in the sample t
exts
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  you can of course also make an extra CDROM track on the CD with the origi
nal modules ...
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I dont know if my music would stand up as just plain music either.. it
's one thing to get people to listen to an S3M.. but to a CD or tape...
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sd: Sure, that is the great thing about CD & CDRom
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  now we are talking about the future... what about the future of Valhalla
?
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Well, hopefully we'll be attending Assembly 95. I'm 99% sure that I pe
rsonally will be. I don't know whether we'll be presenting anyhting there. A lot
 of us have important exams this year, but at least I'll be entering the msuic c
ompos :)
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  You guys are one of the only groups in the world that try to addend al ma
jor parties in the world ?  And even release cool productions everywhere... What
's driving you guys...
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  Well, I guess it is becuase we are relatively new. We have in actual f
act only been present at 3 parties ever! Assembly 94 , The Party 4 and the Gathe
ring 95
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  at the Party, only xToto was there to hand in 'Peripheral Vision'. I
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  guess that the locations help, in that we have xToto in Germany for wh
om it is relatively easy for him to get to a lot of parties
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  Then I have to change my point of view and change it to all Major parties
..  ;-)
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I have only ever been to one party! (TG 95), but try and keep me away
from assembly this year!
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sd: hehe
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  Try to keep me away from any party... the only reason why I wasn't at TG
was '"cause it was in the middle of my exams... for the rest I did all possible
parties starting one year ago...
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sd: Its a shame that V.O.L. crashed at ASM 94, otherwise I think that
Sandman and Nige would have made a great impact on the scene, just to come out o
f nowhere and produce a great demo fro the biggest compo in the world
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sd: Hehe cool!
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  True... but that's was the problem with the whole Assembly... I think you
 read enough stuff about The Real thing etc..  What about the Future of F.M. are
 you planning to do something together ??
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sd: Coming 15th, i dont think V.O.L got the recognition it deserved..
for a first demo, I think it is an amazing acheivement! (remember i didnt know t
hem when they wrote it so I'm not biassed!)
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sd: yep.. hopefully we've got a music disk in the pipline, which *coul
d* (and only could) contain a song that Everyone in the group has worked on toge
ther
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  Anyone in particular going to do the code for it ??
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sd: Not yet, the idea only cropped up this week, but Im sure we'll be
sorying details out soon.
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  I think we'll have to wait and see what happens .. ;-)
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sd: yeah, thats right. Its only a glint in the milmans eye at the mome
nt ;)
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  milkmans
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  Do you have anything in particular to tell to the scene in genreal ??
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I suppose I could say check out the Valhalla web page on http://www.br
ad.ac.uk/~jestorer/
<br><font color="#0000ff">Sleeping Dog :  hehe... I think I even have it in my links..
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  sd: Ok, I just hope im in the chart - otherwise this interview is gonn
a look pretty stoopid! ;)
<br><font color="#ff0000">Big Jim :  I'd also like to say for anyone who is trying to compose computer musi
c... never give up! You will improve with time (If you dont believe that downloa
d Midwash!)
