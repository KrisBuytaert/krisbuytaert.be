The Scene is dying : Mathematical Prove by Sleeping Dog / The
Natives
</h4>
As we can clearly notice at the moment the scene is dying.
Every day 6% of the C64 scene simply stops.  9% of that same
scene move's over to the PC scene and 1% to the Amiga scene.
That makes 16% that leaves the C64 scene a day... Imagine there are
at the moment still 5.000 C64 freaks.  In about 3 months
there will be no C64 scene anymore :(<p>
But the Amiga and PC scene are growing steady.  Or not..
because other recent studies have shown that also the Amiga Scene
is decreasing every day 3% stops and 17% moves to the PC Scene.
So from those 10.000 in about 4 months time the Amiga scene will also
be completely death.  That was if the PC Scene wasn't changing.
Every day at least one PC Scene member considers moving to C64 because
there is almost no competition and it's so easy to make money, but
since it's to hard to find a C64 nowadays they don't.
Some of them also consider moving towards the Amiga scene because
there they will certainly have the fastest 3D engine.
But they find the same problem, impossible to find an A500 and not enough
money to buy a A4000.  So they also stick to the PC Scene.  That
nowadays huge PC Scene is also dying.  Everyday about 10-15 guys join the
scene.  But everyday also about 3% stops because of multiple reasons.
Girlfriend, wive, no money, boredom, or something else.
A short calculation shows that the 20.000 people in the scene will
decrease to 1 in a matter of no time.  And eventually only one guy will
survive them all... guess who...<p>

Off course you all know this article is completely made up.
